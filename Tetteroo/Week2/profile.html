        <p>Hello! I would like to briefly introduce myself; my name is Carlijn (23 y/o, she/her), and I have chosen the MA Book and Digital Media Studies because I have a fascination for old books, and also a great interest in recent developments in the book field. <br />
	B.t.w. the castle in my picture is <a href="https://www.kasteeldehaar.nl">Kasteel de Haar</a> where I am sometimes a guide in the weekends :)</p>
              
	<h2>Languages I speak</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
 		<li>Dutch</li>
 		<li>English</li>
 		<li>German</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

     	<h2>Academic Background</h2>
        <p>I followed the BA English Language and Culture at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl">Leiden University</a> from 2018-2022. During my studies, I also followed a Neuroscience minor at <a href="https://www.eur.nl">Erasmus University, Rotterdam</a>, and I studied for one year at <a href="https://www.bangor.ac.uk"> Bangor University, Wales</a> as part of the Harting exchange programme.</p>
  
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I love to read, go hiking, cook and bake, visit second-hand shops or markets, visit historic towns or museums, collect old/vintage books (more on that later!), records, furniture and clothes, and I like to embroider, knit, paint and pick up new hobbies as I go (I would love to start sewing in the near future!).</p>

	<h2>Archive of Antiques</h2> 
	<p>I have been collecting old books from second-hand shops, markets and charity shops for some 5 years now. The books are in English, French, Dutch and Italian, and have a broad range of topics, from literature to non-fiction. My oldest books are a set of two volumes of French fables from 1709.<br />
	I, by no means, know what I'm doing, but it's been very fun over the years! Some years ago I also started an instagram account to document my collection, if you'd like, you can check it out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/archive.of.antiques">here</a>!</p>

	<h2>Bookish Highlights</h2>
	<p> Here are some of my personal favourite Bookish Highlights!
	<ul>
 		<li><b><a href="https://www.hayfestival.com/home">The Hay Festival</a></b><br /> The town Hay-on-Wye in Wales is the first official 'Book Town' and is filled to the brim with bookshops. During the Hay Festival, authors and speakers from all over the world come to this town to give talks, sign books and celebrate reading. I've been twice now, and think it's absolutely magical!</li>
 		<li><b><a href="https://www.library.wales">The National Library of Wales</a></b><br /> I visited the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth two years ago, and was able to see special exhibitions on the development of the dictionary, books with beautiful covers, and surprising art collections as well.</li>
 		<li><b><a href="https://www.bibliotheekdeventer.nl/athenaeumbibliotheek.html">Athenaeumbibliotheek</a></b><br /> This library in Deventer is the oldest city library of the Netherlands, founded in 1560. During the Open Monument Weekend, I could view their special collections.</li>
		<li><b><a href="https://librije-zutphen.nl">Librije</a></b><br /> This small library sits in the corner of the Walburgis church in Zutphen, and is one of the only chained libraries in the world that is still in its original state since 1562. It contains early printed books, such as the one on display from 1477.</li>
	</ul>

		<td style="width:20%"><b>Prior Knowledge</b></td> <td>I used a little HTML to code my entry for the <a href="https://openmedieval.leidenuniv.nl/">TOMES project</a>, and I have used HTML en CSS to create an e-book for my E-publishing course.</td>
