Dear Sirs,
In reply to your inquiry concerning ????? the good life ( ???? ) this has not yet been published. For reasons which will be all too familiar to you, it has been continually held off. It is hoped, howsoever (?), that the book will appear this summer; ? of course, as soon as it is published, the fee for Mr. Frank Prewett’s poem will be forwarded.

Yours faithfully, 
C. Henry Warren 


Letter from Denis Ireland to to Leonard Woolf

Dear Mr. Woolf: 
I enclose a carbon copy of a commentary which I have just written on Ivan Bunin’s story The Gentleman from San Francisco. This is based largely on the translation by yourself, D.H.Lawerence, and S.S.Koteliansky which you re-issued in 1934, and it forms part of a book I am writing, a notebook with commentaries on books and events, on the lines of my From the Irish Shore, published in 1936 by Rich & Cowan. 
Meanwhile I had thought of using this section of my book as a magazine article, and I was wondering if you would have any objection to the quotations as shown in the enclosed carbon copy. The total number of words quoted is, at a rough calculation, about 1500, and the number of separate quotations 11. Acknowledgement would, of course, be made, as shown. I’m sorry the carbon is not more distinct, but it is a bottom copy. 
I enclose a stamped, addressed envelope. 

Yours sincerely, 
DENIS IRELAND.
