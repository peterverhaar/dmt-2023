      "You read in novels about “priceless little Elzevirs,” about books “as rare as an old Elzevir.” I have met, in the works of a lady novelist (but not elsewhere), with an Elzevir ‘Theocritus.’ The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon introduced into one of his romances a romantic Elzevir Greek Testament, “worth its weight in gold.” Casual remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion that all Elzevirs are pearls of considerable price.\n",
      "When a man is first smitten with the pleasant fever of book-collecting, it is for Elzevirs that he searches.\n",
      "Dr. Lemuel Gulliver remarks that the King of Lilliput was taller than any of his court by almost the breadth of a nail, and that his altitude filled the minds of all with awe.\n",
      "‘You can have it for six sous,’ he answered; ‘is it too much?’ ‘No,’ said I, and, trembling a little, I handed him the thirty centimes he asked for the ‘Pastissier François.’ You may believe, my friend, that after such a piece of luck at the start, one goes home fondly embracing the beloved object of one’s search.\n",
      "Equally fine is the ‘Cæsar’ of 1635, which, with the ‘Virgil’ of 1636 and the ‘Imitation’ without date, M. Willems thinks the most successful works of the Elzevirs, “one of the most enviable jewels in the casket of the bibliophile.” It may be recognised by the page 238, which is erroneously printed 248.\n",
      "Let the fate of this bold, bad man be a warning to wicked earls, baronets, and all others who attempt to destroy the record of the marriage of a hero’s parents.\n",
      "Thus the local antiquary would really have his work made more easy for him (though it may be doubted whether he would quite enjoy that condescension), while the villain of romance would be foiled; for it is useless (as a novel of Mr. Christie Murray’s proves) to alter the register in the keeping of the parish when the original document is safe in the Record Office.\n",
      "If they were reproduced, again, by any process of photography, the old difficult court hand would remain as hard as ever.\n",
      "But this is a minor objection, for the local antiquary revels in the old court hand.\n",
      "‘On accuse Henri VIII.,’ dit Madame de Flamareil, “moi je le comprends, et je l’absous; c’était un cœur généreux, lorsqu’il ne les aimait plus, il les tuait.’” The public of England mistrusted, in the matter of parish registers, the generous heart of Henry VIII.\n",
      "The tymes were _such_!” At Hilton, in Dorset, William Snoke, minister, entered his opinion that persons whose baptism and marriage were not registered “will be made uncapable of any earthly inheritance if they live.\n",

      "This nearly broke his father’s heart.\n",

      "The motives of the literary forger are curiously mixed; but they may, perhaps, be analysed roughly into piety, greed, “push,” and love of fun.\n",
      "We may generally ascribe them to love of notoriety in the forger; such notoriety as Macpherson won by his dubious pinchbeck Ossian.\n",
      "This ingenious impostor worked on old epic materials, but added many new ideas of his own about the gods, converting the Iliad (the poem which we now possess) into a kind of mocking romance, a Greek Don Quixote.\n",
      "Dr. Ingleby, in the ardour of his honest indignation, pursues William into his private life, which, it appears, was far from exemplary.\n",
      "When the parcel was opened, the heart of the Bibliophile began to sing, for the packet contained two old folios, one of them an old folio Shakespeare of the second edition (1632).\n",
      "THE love of books for their own sake, for their paper, print, binding, and for their associations, as distinct from the love of literature, is a stronger and more universal passion in France than elsewhere in Europe.\n",
      "In France people buy books, and bind them to their heart’s desire with quaint and dainty devices on the morocco covers.\n",
      "The greatest French writers have been collectors of curious editions; they have devoted whole treatises to the love of books.\n",
      "There lies before us at this moment a small library of books about books,—the ‘Bibliophile Français,’ in seven large volumes, ‘Les Sonnets d’un Bibliophile,’ ‘La Bibliomanie en 1878,’ ‘La Bibliothèque d’un Bibliophile’ (1885) and a dozen other works of Janin, Nodier, Beraldi, Pieters, Didot, great collectors who have written for the instruction of beginners and the pleasure of every one who takes delight in printed paper.\n",
      "So universal and ardent has the love of magnificent books been in France, that it would be possible to write a kind of bibliomaniac history of that country.\n",
      "“Can a woman be a bibliophile?” is a question which was once discussed at the weekly breakfast party of Guilbert de Pixérécourt, the famous book-lover and playwright, the “Corneille of the Boulevards.” The controversy glided into a discussion as to “how many books a man can love at a time;” but historical examples prove that French women (and Italian, witness the Princess d’Este) may be bibliophiles of the true strain.\n",
      "In the love of books, as in everything else, Diane and Henri II.\n",
      "M. Léopold Double, a well-known bibliophile, possessed several examples.\n",
      "scarcely deserves, perhaps, the name of a book-lover, for he probably never read the works which were bound for him in the most elaborate way.\n",
      "The board of one of his books, of which an engraving lies before me, bears his cipher and crown in the corners; but the centre is occupied in front with a picture of the Annunciation, while on the back is the crucifixion and the breeding heart through which the swords have pierced.\n",
      "With the instinct, the _flair_, as the French say, of the bibliophile, M. Ambroise Firmin Didot, the biographer of Aldus, guessed that the marquis might have owned something in his line.\n",
      "In 1664, Naudé, who was a learned and ingenious writer, the apologist for “great men suspected of magic,” published the second edition of his ‘Avis pour dresser une Bibliothèque,’ and proved himself to be a true lover of the chase, a mighty hunter (of books) before the Lord.\n",
      "In the second place, he advised the book-lover to haunt the retreats of _Libraires fripiers_, _et les vieux fonds et magasins_.\n",
      "There is a painful description of the sale, from which the book-lover will avert his eyes.\n",
      "Among princes and popes it is pleasant to meet one man of letters, and he the greatest of the great age, who was a bibliophile.\n",
      "The enemies and rivals of Molière—De Visé, De Villiers, and the rest—are always reproaching him—with his love of _bouquins_.\n",
      "It is certain—La Bruyère tells us as much—that the sillier sort of book-lover in the seventeenth century was much the same sort of person as his successor in our own time.\n",
      ". . and informs me that ‘he never reads,’ that ‘he never sets foot in this part of his house,’ that he ‘will come to oblige me!’ I thank him for all his kindness, and have no more desire than himself to see the tanner’s shop that he calls his library.” Colbert, the great minister of Louis XIV., was a bibliophile at whom perhaps La Bruyère would have sneered.\n",
      "When only thirteen she married the Comte de Verrue, who somewhat injudiciously presented her, a _fleur de quinze ans_, as Ronsard says, at the court of Victor Amadeus of Savoy.\n",
      "For some reason the young matron fled from the court of Turin and returned to Paris, where she built a magnificent hotel, and received the most distinguished company.\n",
      "“Without care for the present, without fear of the future, doing good, pursuing the beautiful, protecting the arts, with a tender heart and open hand, the countess passed through life, calm, happy, beloved, and admired.” She left an epitaph on herself, thus rudely translated:— Here lies, in sleep secure, A dame inclined to mirth, Who, by way of making sure, Chose her Paradise on earth.\n",
      "The Duc d’Aumale, a famous bibliophile, has never “come to his own,” and of M. Gambetta it is only known that his devotional library, at least, has found its way into the market.\n",
      "The Romantic movement in French literature brought in some new fashions in book-hunting.\n",
      "On one occasion, when he was outbid by a friend at an auction, he cried passionately, “I shall have that book at your sale!” and, the other poor bibliophile soon falling into a decline and dying, Pixérécourt got the volume which he so much desired.\n",
      "On Pixérécourt himself the evil eye fell at last; his theatre, the Gaieté, was burned down in 1835, and his creditors intended to impound his beloved books.\n",
      "The bibliophile hastily packed them in boxes, and conveyed them in two cabs and under cover of night to the house of M. Paul Lacroix.\n",
      "A chivalric romance of the old days, which was treasured even in the time of the _grand monarque_, when old French literature was so much despised, is certainly a curiosity.\n",
      "Let the enthusiast, in conclusion, throw a handful of lilies on the grave of the martyr of the love of books,—the poet Albert Glatigny.\n",
      "{119b} Galliot du Pré’s artist, however, surpassed even the charming device of the Lover plucking the Rose, in his title-page, of the same date, for the small octavo edition of Alain Chartier’s poems, which we reproduce here.\n",
      "Love, with the bandage thrust back from his eyes, and with the bow and arrows in his hand, has flown up to the sun, which he seems to touch; like Prometheus in the myth when he stole the fire, a shower of flowers and flames falls around him.\n",
      "These are beautifully combined in the title-page of his version of Apuleius, ‘L’Amour de Cupido et de Psyche’ (Paris, 1557).\n",
      "By 1565 Richard Breton, in Paris, was printing Rabelais with a frontispiece of a classical dame holding a heart to the sun, a figure which is almost in the taste of Stothard, or Flaxman.\n"

      "He will, on the contrary, look upon Cecil as a lover of books, not for the sake of the numerous panegyrical dedications to himself, which he must have so satisfactorily perused, but for the sake of the good to be derived from useful and ingenious works.\n",

      "It remains to observe, that our ARCHBISHOP was a bibliomaniac of the very first order; and smitten with every thing attached to a BOOK, to a degree beyond any thing exhibited by his contemporaries.\n",
      "Such was his ardour for book-collecting that he had agents in almost all places, abroad and at home, for the purpose of securing everything that was curious, precious, and rare: and one of these, of the name of Batman (I suppose the commentator upon Bartholomæus) \"in the space of no more than four years, procured for our archbishop to the number of 6700 books.\"\n",

      "Alas, poor DEE!--thou wert the dupe of the people and of the Court: and, although Meric Casaubon has enshrined thy conjurations in a pompous folio volume, thy name, I fear, will only live in the memory of bibliomaniacs!\n",
      "In Germany he was tempted with the yearly salary of 3000 dollars; \"and lastly, by a messenger from the Russie or Muscovite Emperor, purposely sent with a very rich present unto him at Trebona castle, and with provision for the whole journey (being above 1200 miles from the castle where he lay) of his coming to his court at Moscow, with his wife, children, and whole family, there to enjoy at his imperial hands 2000 lib.\n",
      "\"The Queen Elizabeth herself became a prisoner in the same place (Hampton Court) shortly afterwards; and Dee had for bedfellow one Barthelet Green, who was afterwards burnt.\"\n",
      "In 1591, his patroness, the Countess of Warwick, made a powerful diversion at Court to secure for him the mastership of St. Cross, then filled by Dr. Bennet, who was to be made a bishop.--The queen qualified her promise of Dee's having it with a nota bene, _if he should be fit for it_.\n",
      "In 1592, the Archbishop of Canterbury openly \"affirmed that the mastership of St. Crosse was a living most fit for him; and the Lord Treasurer, at Hampton Court, lately to himself declared, and with his hand very earnestly smitten on his breast used these very words to him--'_By my faith_, if her Majestie be moved in it by any other for you, I will do what I can with her Majestie to pleasure you therein, Mr.\n",

      "In consequence, Sir Robert declared to his friends, \"that they had broken his heart who had locked up his library from him:\" which declaration he solemnly repeated to the Privy Council.\n",
      "Equally celebrated for literary zeal, and yet more for bibliomaniacal enthusiasm, was the famous SIR THOMAS BODLEY; whose account of himself, in _Prince's Worthies of Devon_, and particularly in one of _Hearne's publications_,[335] can never be read without transport by an affectionate son of our Oxford _Alma Mater_.\n",
      "How long the subject of his beloved library had occupied his attention it is perhaps of equal difficulty and unimportance to know; but his determination to carry this noble plan into effect is thus pleasingly communicated to us by his own pen: \"when I had, I say, in this manner, represented to my thoughts, my peculiar estate, I resolved thereupon to possess my soul in peace all the residue of my days; to take my full farewell of state employments; to satisfy my mind with that mediocrity of worldly living that I have of my own, and so to retire me from the Court; which was the epilogue and end of all my actions and endeavours, of any important note, till I came to the age of fifty-three years.\"\n",
      "I have been always of a mind that, if God, of his goodness, should make me able to do any thing, for the benefit of posterity, I would shew some token of affection, that I have ever more borne, to the studies of good learning.\n",
      "Your affectionate friend, THO.\n",
      "And though their answer of acceptance were over thankful and respective; yet I take it unto me for a singular comfort, that it came for that affection, whose thanks in that behalf I do esteem a great deal more than they have reason to esteem a far better offer.\n",
      "But of these and other points, when I send you my project, I will both write more of purpose, and impart unto you freely my best cogitations, being evermore desirous, whatsoever may concern your public good, to procure and advance it so, to the uttermost of my power: as now in the meanwhile, reminding unto you my fervent affection, I rest for any service, Your most assured, at commandment, THO.\n",
      "With which unfeigned testification of my devotion unto you, and with my daily fervent prayers for the endless prosperity of your joint endeavours, in that whole institution of your public library, I will close up this letter, and rest, as I shall ever, Yours, in all loving and dutiful affection, THOMAS BODLEY.\n",
      "The _first part_ is devoted entirely to Divinity: and in the dedicatory epistle to Queen Elizabeth, Maunsell tells her majesty that he thought it \"worth his poor labour to collect a catalogue of the divine books, so mightily increased in her reign; whereby her majesty's most faithful and loving subjects may be put in remembrance of the works of so excellent authors,\" &c. The second part is devoted to a brief account of books in the remaining branches of literature, arts, sciences, &c. Maunsell promised to follow it up by a _third_ part; but a want of due encouragement seems to have damped the bibliographical ardour of the compiler; for this third part never appeared: a circumstance which, in common with the late Mr. Steevens, all bibliomaniacs may \"much lament.\"\n",
      "Ludovicus Vives, who was Latimer's contemporary, has attacked both schoolmasters and youths, in an ungracious style; saying of the former that \"some taught Ovid's books of love to their scholars, and some make expositions and expounded the vices.\"\n",

      "Contemporaneous with Peacham, lived that very curious collector of ancient popular little pieces, as well as lover of \"sacred secret soul soliloquies,\" the renowned _melancholy_ composer, ycleped ROBERT BURTON;[345] who, I do not scruple to number among the most marked bibliomaniacs of the age; notwithstanding his saucy railing against Frankfort book-fairs.\n",

      "Yes, Lisardo; it is truly curious to think upon the _Little Gidding Monastery_--near which, perhaps, were ----\"rugged rocks, that holy knees had worn--\" and to imagine that the occupiers of such a place were infected--nay, inflamed--with a most powerful ardour for curious, neat, splendid, and, I dare venture to affirm, matchless copies of the several volumes which they composed!\n",
      "The introduction is told in such a pleasing style of _naiveté_, and the manual dexterity of the young bibliomaniac is so smartly commended by Charles, that I cannot find it in my heart to abridge much of the narrative.\n",
      "He, falling down on his knees, the king gave him his hand to kiss, bidding him rise up.\n",

      "To my dear cosin, George Baker, of Crook, Esq., I leave the _Life of Cardinal Wolsey_, noted with my own hand, _Lord Clarendon's History_, with cuts and prints; and _Winwood's Memorials_, in three volumes, fol., with a five pound (Jacobus) piece of gold, only as a mark of respect and affection, since he does not want it.\n",

      "[Illustration] =The Bibliomania.= MY DEAR SIR, When the poetical Epistle of Dr. Ferriar, under the popular title of \"THE BIBLIOMANIA,\" was announced for publication, I honestly confess that, in common with many of my book-loving acquaintance, a strong sensation of fear and of hope possessed me: of fear, that I might have been accused, however indirectly, of having contributed towards the increase of this Mania; and of hope, that the true object of book-collecting, and literary pursuits, might have been fully and fairly developed.\n",
      "This discovery may be considered, in some measure, as the result of the BIBLIOMANIA.\n",
      "Thus when Pope talks of allotting for \"Pembroke[7] Statues, dirty Gods and Coins; Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne[8] alone; And books to Mead[9] and butterflies to Sloane,\"[10] when he says that These Aldus[11] printed, those Du S[=u]eil has bound[12] moreover that For Locke or Milton[13] 'tis in vain to look; These shelves admit not any modern book; he not only seems to illustrate the propriety of the foregoing remark, by shewing the immense superiority of verse to prose, in ridiculing reigning absurdities, but he seems to have had a pretty strong foresight of the BIBLIOMANIA which rages at the present day.\n",
      "Those who are anxious to procure the rare books mentioned in these bibliographical treatises, may be pretty safely taxed with being infected by the BIBLIOMANIA.\n",
      "And what, you will say, has this to do with Book Collectors and Books?--Much, every way: a nation thus glorious is, at this present eventful moment, afflicted not only with the Dog[16], but the BOOK, disease-- Fire in each eye, and paper in each hand They rave, recite,---- [Footnote 15: \"JOHN BAGFORD, by profession a bookseller, frequently travelled into Holland and other parts, in search of scarce books and valuable prints, and brought a vast number into this kingdom, the greatest part of which were purchased by the Earl of Oxford.\n",

      "Let us enquire, therefore, into the origin and tendency of the BIBLIOMANIA.\n",
      "It has raged chiefly in palaces, castles, halls, and gay mansions; and those things which in general are supposed not to be inimical to health, such as cleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour, are only so many inducements towards the introduction and propagation of the BIBLIOMANIA!\n",
      "All these treatises afford abundant proof of the hopelessness of cure in cases of the Bibliomania.]\n",
      "We will now, my dear Sir, begin \"making out the catalogue\" of victims to the BIBLIOMANIA!\n",
      "[18] I discover no other notorious example of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA until the time of Henry VII.\n",
      "[19] It would appear, too, that, about this time, the BIBLIOMANIA was increased by the introduction of foreign printed books; and it is not very improbable that a portion of Henry's immense wealth was devoted towards the purchase of VELLUM copies, which were now beginning to be published by the great typographical triumvirate, Verard, Eustace, and Pigouchet.\n",
      "His passion for book-collecting was unbounded [\"vir ardentis ingenii,\" says Petrarch of him]; and in order to excite the same ardour in his countrymen, or rather to propagate the disease of the BIBLIOMANIA with all his might, he composed a bibliographical work under the title of _Philobiblion_; concerning the first edition of which, printed at Spires in 1483, Clement (tom.\n",

      "While the country was thus giving proofs of the prevalence of this disorder, the two Harringtons (especially the younger)[28] and the illustrious Spenser[29] were unfortunately seized with it in the metropolis.\n",
      "During this century our great reasoners and philosophers began to be in motion; and, like the fumes of tobacco, which drive the concealed and clotted insects from the interior to the extremity of the leaves, the infectious particles of the BIBLIOMANIA set a thousand busy brains a-thinking, and produced ten thousand capricious works, which, over-shadowed by the majestic remains of Bacon, Locke, and Boyle, perished for want of air, and warmth, and moisture.\n",

      "while the Bibliographer exults in, or hopes for, the possession of such treasures, the physiologist discovers therein fresh causes of disease, and the philanthropist mourns over the ravages of the BIBLIOMANIA!]\n",
      "The years 1755-6 were singularly remarkable for the mortality excited by the BIBLIOMANIA; and the well known names of Folkes,[39] and Rawlinson,[40] might have supplied a modern Holbein a hint for the introduction of a new subject in the \"_Dance of Death_.\"\n",
      "These three striking instances of the fatality of the Bibliomania occurred--the first in the year 1764; and the latter in 1773.\n",

      "But death--who, as Horace tells us, raps equally at the palaces of kings and cottages of peasants, made no scruple to exercise the knocker of the Doctor's door, and sent, as his avant-courier, THIS DEPLORABLE MANIA!\n",
      "The subsequent history of the disease is a striking proof of the truth of this remark; for the madness of book-collecting rather increased--and the work of death still went on.\n",
      "In the year 1776 died John Ratcliffe[47] another, and a very singular, instance of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA.\n",
      "We have brought down our researches to within a similar period of the present times; but, as Addison has not made out the proofs of such assertion, and as many of the relatives and friends of those who have fallen victims to the BIBLIOMANIA, since the days of Ratcliffe, may yet be alive; moreover, as it is the part of humanity not to tear open wounds which have been just closed, or awaken painful sensibilities which have been well nigh laid to rest; so, my dear Sir, in giving you a further account of this fatal disorder, I deem it the most prudent method _not to expatiate_ upon the subsequent examples of its mortality.\n",
      "The ingenious Peignot, in the first volume of his 'Dictionnaire Bibliologie,' p. 51, defines the Bibliomania[48] to be \"a passion for possessing books; not so much to be instructed by them, as to gratify the eye by looking on them.\n",
      "He who is affected by this mania knows books only by their titles and dates, and is rather seduced by the exterior than interior\"!\n",
      "\"Bruyere has touched on this mania with humour; of such a collector (one who is fond of superb bindings only) says he, as soon as I enter his house, I am ready to faint on the stair-case from a strong smell of morocco leather.\n",
      "This[50] symptom of the Bibliomania is, at the present day, both general and violent, and threatens to extend still more widely.\n",
      "Even modern publications are not exempt from its calamitous influence; and when Mr. Miller, the bookseller, told me with what eagerness the large paper copies of Lord Valentia's Travels were bespoke, and Mr. Evans shewed me that every similar copy of his new edition of \"Burnett's History of his own Times\" was disposed of, I could not help elevating my eyes and hands, in token of commiseration at the prevalence of this Symptom of the BIBLIOMANIA!\n",
      "_Uncut Copies._ Of all the symptoms of the Bibliomania, this is probably the most extraordinary.\n",
      "Indeed, when I look around in my book-lined tub, I cannot but be conscious that this symptom of the disorder has reached my own threshold; but when it is known that a few of my bibliographical books are left with the edges uncut _merely to please my friends_ (as one must sometimes study their tastes and appetites as well as one's own), I trust that no very serious conclusions will be drawn about the probable fatality of my own case.\n",
      "_Illustrated Copies._ A passion for books illustrated or adorned with numerous prints, representing characters or circumstances mentioned in the work, is a very general and violent symptom of the Bibliomania, which has been known chiefly within the last half century.\n",
      "Nor did the madness stop here.\n",
      "From these it has glanced off in a variety of directions, to adorn the pages of humbler wights; and the passion, or rather this symptom of the Bibliomania,[55] yet rages with undiminished force.\n",
      "There is another mode of illustrating copies by which this symptom of the Bibliomania may be known: it consists in bringing together, from different works, [by means of the scissors, or otherwise by transcription] every page or paragraph which has any connection with the character or subject under discussion.\n",
      "_Unique Copies._ A passion for a book which has any peculiarity about it, by either, or both, of the foregoing methods of illustration--or which is remarkable for its size, beauty, and condition--is indicative of a rage for _unique copies_, and is unquestionably a strong prevailing symptom of the Bibliomania.\n",
      "V. _Copies printed on vellum._ A desire for works printed in this manner is an equally strong and general symptom of the Bibliomania; but as these works are rarely to be obtained of modern[60] date, the collector is obliged to have recourse to specimens, executed three centuries ago, in the printing-offices of Aldus, Verard, and the Juntæ.\n",
      "Mr. Edward's _unique_ copy (he will forgive the epithet) of the first Livy, upon vellum, is a Library of itself!--and the recent discovery of a vellum copy of Wynkyn De Worde's reprint of _Juliana Barnes's book_,[61] complete in every respect, [to say nothing of his Majesty's similar copy of Caxton's _Doctrinal of Sapience_, 1489, in the finest preservation] are, to be sure, sufficient demonstrations of the prevalence of this symptom of the Bibliomania in the times of our forefathers; so that it cannot be said, as some have asserted, to have appeared entirely within the last half century.\n",
      "Whoever is possessed with a passion for collecting books of this kind may unquestionably be said to exhibit a strong symptom of the Bibliomania; but such a case is not quite hopeless, nor is it deserving of severe treatment or censure.\n",
      "i., 672, &c.] about the elder ANCILLON, who frankly confessed that he \"was troubled with the BIBLIOMANIA, or disease of buying books.\"\n",
      "This particular pursuit may therefore be called another, or the seventh, symptom of the Bibliomania.\n",
      "Of all symptoms of the Bibliomania, this eighth symptom (and the last which I shall notice) is at present the most powerful and prevailing.\n",
      "_Rare._ Printed by Anoke and Astile 1 8 0] A perusal of these articles may probably not impress the reader with any lofty notions of the superiority of the black letter; but this symptom of the Bibliomania is, nevertheless, not to be considered as incurable, or wholly unproductive of good.\n",
      "In short, though this be also a strong and general symptom of the Bibliomania, it is certainly not attended with injurious effects when regulated by prudence and discretion.\n",
      "Having in the two preceding divisions of this letter discoursed somewhat largely upon the HISTORY and SYMPTOMS of the Bibliomania, it now remains, according to the original plan, to say a few words upon the PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE.\n",
      "PROBABLE MEANS OF THE CURE of the Bibliomania.\n",
      "But, as this is a disorder of quite a recent date, and as its characteristics, in consequence, cannot be yet fully known or described, great candour must be allowed to that physician who offers a prescription for so obscure and complicated a case.\n",
      "With a trembling hand, and fearful apprehension, therefore, I throw out the following suggestions for the cure, or mitigatiou [Transcriber's Note: mitigation], of this disorder: In _the first place_, the disease of the Bibliomania is materially softened, or rendered mild, by directing our studies to _useful and profitable_ works--whether these be printed upon small or large paper, in the gothic, roman, or italic type; To consider purely the _intrinsic_ excellence, and not the exterior splendour, or adventitious value, of any production, will keep us perhaps wholly free from this disease.\n",
      "In the _second place_, the re-printing of scarce and intrinsically valuable works is another means of preventing the propagation of this disorder.\n",
      "Amidst all our present sufferings under the BIBLIOMANIA, it is some consolation to find discerning and spirited booksellers re-publishing the valuable Chronicles of Froissart, Holinshed, and Hall,[69] and the collections known by the names of \"The Harleïan Miscellany,\" and \"Lord Somer's Tracts.\"\n",
      "In the _third place_, the editing of our best ancient authors, whether in prose or poetry,[70] is another means of effectually counteracting the progress of the Bibliomania, as it has been described under its several symptoms.\n",
      "Thus briefly and guardedly have I thrown out a few suggestions, which may enable us to avoid, or mitigate the severity of, the disease called THE BIBLIOMANIA.\n",
      "If, therefore, in the wide survey which a philosopher may take of the \"Miseries of Human life\"[74] the prevalence of this disorder may appear to be less mischievous than that of others, and, if some of the most amiable and learned of mortals seemed to have been both unwilling, as well as unable, to avoid its contagion, you will probably feel the less alarmed if symptoms of it should appear within the sequestered abode of Hodnet!\n",
      "Upon the whole, therefore, attending closely to the symptoms of this disorder as they have been described, and practising such means of cure as have been recommended, we may rationally hope that its virulence may abate, and the number of its victims annually diminish.\n",
      "But if the more discerning part of the community anticipate a different result, and the preceding observations appear to have presented but a narrow and partial view of the mischiefs of the BIBLIOMANIA, my only consolation is that to advance _something_ upon the subject is better than to preserve a sullen and invincible silence.\n",
      "Nothing short of _infallibility_ and _invincibility_ satisfied him; and, like the Spaniard in the 'Diable Boiteux,' who went mad because five of his countrymen had been beaten by fifty Portugese, this unhappy creature lost all patience and forbearance, because, in an hundred systems which he had built with the cards of fancy, ninety-nine happened to tumble to the ground.\n",
      "I recollect, one evening, he came rushing into a party where I sat, screaming with the extatic joy of a maniac--'[Greek: Eurêka, Eurêka]'; and, throwing down a scroll, rushed as precipitately out of the room.\n"

      "There was no mistake about it, the good bibliophile knew Rousseau’s handwriting perfectly well; to make still more sure he paid his seventy-five centimes for the book, and walked across the Pont des Arts, to his bookbinder’s, where he had a copy of Rousseau’s works, with a facsimile of his handwriting.\n",
      "M. de Latour did not suppose that “dans ce bas monde it fût permis aux joies du bibliophile d’aller encore plus loin.” He imagined that the delights of the amateur could only go further, in heaven.\n",
      "But M. de Latour was an enthusiast, and this little p. 28anecdote of his explains the sentimental side of the bibliophile’s pursuit.\n",
      "Yes, it is sentiment that makes us feel a lively affection for the books that seem to connect us with great poets and students long ago dead.\n",
      "p. 32In our modern times, as the industrious Bibliophile Jacob, says, the fashion of book-collecting has changed; “from the vast hall that it was, the library of the amateur has shrunk to a closet, to a mere book-case.\n",
      "The amateur, then, is the person we have in our eye, and especially the bibliophile who has but lately been bitten with this pleasant mania of collecting.\n",
      "There was once a bibliophile who said that a man could only love one book at a time, and the darling of the moment he used to carry about in a charming leather case.\n",
      "As to furniture, people who can afford it will imitate the arrangements of Lucullus, in Mr. Hill Burton’s p. 37charming volume “The Book-hunter” (Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1862).—“Everything is of perfect finish,—the mahogany-railed gallery, the tiny ladders, the broad winged lecterns, with leathern cushions on the edges to keep the wood from grazing the rich bindings, the books themselves, each shelf uniform with its facings, or rather backings, like well-dressed lines at a review.” The late Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, a famous bibliophile, invented a very nice library chair.\n",
      "“Say, shall I sing of rats,” asked Grainger, when reading to Johnson his epic, the “Sugar-cane.” “No,” said the Doctor; and though rats are the foe of the bibliophile, at least as much as of the sugar-planter, we do not propose to sing of them.\n",
      "M. Fertiault has done so already in “Les Sonnets d’un Bibliophile,” where the reader must be pleased with the beautiful etchings of rats devouring an illuminated MS., and battening on p. 41morocco bindings stamped with the bees of De Thou.\n",
      "But the amateur, however refined himself, must beware of men who love not fly leaves neither regard margins, but write notes over the latter, and light their pipes with the former.\n",
      "“Had I but kenn’d, Tamlane,” she says, “Before ye came frae hame, I wad ta’en out your heart o’ flesh, Put in a heart o’ stane!” Above the lintel of his library door, Pixérécourt had this couplet carved— p. 45“Tel est le triste sort de tout livre prêté, Souvent il est perdu, toujours il est gâté.” M. Paul Lacroix says he would not have lent a book to his own daughter.\n",
      "Mr. Leicester Warren and M. Poulet Malassis have written the history of these slender works of art, and each bibliophile may have his own engraved, and may formulate his own anathemas on people who borrow and restore not again.\n",
      "The process is futile, but may comfort the heart, like the curses against thieves which the Greeks were wont to scratch on leaden tablets, and deposit in the temple of Demeter.\n",
      "Each amateur can exercise his own taste in the design of a book-plate; and for such as love and collect rare editions of “Homer,” I venture to suggest this motto, which may move the heart of p. 46the borrower to send back an Aldine copy of the epic— πέμψον ἐπισταμένως, δύνασαι γάρ ὥς κε γάλ’ ἀσκηθὴς ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηται.\n"

      "The defect is indifference, and the man who is defective as to the love of books has no name in common parlance.\n",
      "As to the man who is exactly in the right mean, we call him the book-lover.\n",
      "Thus his felicity partakes of the nature of the bliss we attribute to the gods, for that also is contemplative, and we call the book-lover ‘happy,’ and even ‘blessed,’ but within the limits of mortal happiness.\n",
      "But, just as in the matter of absence of fear there is a mean which we call courage, and a defect which we call cowardice, and an excess which is known as foolhardiness; so it is in the case of the love of books.\n",
      "As to the mean, we have seen that it is the virtue of the true book-lover, while the defect constitutes the sin of the Robustious Philistine.\n",

      "M. Octave Uzanne, in a tract called “Les Caprices d’un Bibliophile,” gives some hints on this topic, which may be taken or let alone.\n",
      "He proposes to use old scraps of brocade, embroidery, Venice velvet, or what not; and doubtless a covering made of some dead fair lady’s train goes well with a romance by Crébillon, and engravings by Marillier.\n",
      "Here, in short, is an almost unexplored field for the taste of the bibliophile, who, with some expenditure of time, and not much of money, may make half-binding an art, and give modern books a peculiar and appropriate raiment.\n",

      "There is a vellum copy of the celebrated Florentine first edition of Homer; but it is truly sad to think that the twin volumes, Iliad and Odyssey, have been separated, and pine in distant libraries.\n",
      "Among old illustrated books, the most famous, and one of the rarest, is the “Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,” “wherein all human matters are proved to be no more than a dream.” This is an allegorical romance, published in 1499, for Francesco Colonna, by Aldus Manucius.\n",
      "“Brother Francesco Colonna dearly loved Polia,” is the inscription and device of this romance.\n",
      "Here is a translation of the passage in which the lady describes the beginning of his affection.\n",
      "[6] On a sudden, Poliphilus beheld me, and could not withdraw from me his glances of fire, and even in that moment a ray of the sun of love was kindled in his heart.” The fragment is itself a picture from the world of the Renaissance.\n",
      "We watch the blonde, learned lady, dreaming of Perseus, and Lucius, Greek lovers of old time, while the sun gilds her yellow hair, and the young monk, passing below, sees and loves, and “falls into the deep waters of desire.” The lover is no less learned than the lady, and there is a great deal of amorous archæology in his account of his voyage to Cythera.\n",
      "Here it may be said, in passing, that an early copy of William Blake’s “Songs of Innocence,” written, illustrated, printed, coloured, and boarded by the author’s own hand, is one of the most charming objects that a bibliophile can hope to possess.\n",

      "Agnes’ Eve” in the “Keepsake.” But the plates were, after all, the leading attraction.\n",
      "Turner also illustrated Scott, Milton, Campbell, and Byron; but this series of designs has not received equal commendation from his greatest eulogist, who declares them to be “much more laboured, and more or less artificial and unequal.” Among the numerous imitations directly induced by the Rogers books was the “Lyrics of the Heart,” by Alaric Attila Watts, a forgotten versifier and sometime editor of “Annuals,” but it did not meet with similar success.\n",
      "From the starved ewe in the snow nibbling forlornly at a worn-out broom, to the cow which has broken through the rail to reach the running water, there are numberless designs which reveal that faithful lover of the field and hillside, who, as he said, “would rather be herding sheep on Mickle bank top” than remain in London to be made premier of England.\n",
      "Many of these little groups would make admirable designs for gems, if indeed they are not already derived from them, since one at least is an obvious copy of a well-known sardonyx—(“The Marriage of Cupid and Psyche.”) This volume, generally known by the name of the “Firebrand” edition, is highly prized by collectors; and, as intelligent renderings of pen and ink, there is little better than these p. 146engravings of Clennell’s.\n",
      "The “Triumph of Cupid,” which begins the “Table Book,” is an excellent instance of his lavish wealth of fancy, and it contains beside, one—nay more than one—of the many portraits of the artist.\n",

      "As to this question of making money by p. 7collecting, Mr. Hill Burton speaks very distinctly in “The Book-hunter:” “Where money is the object let a man speculate or become a miser.\n",

      "Under his vast umbrella the book-hunter is secure and content; he enjoys the pleasures of the sport unvexed by poachers, and thinks less of the heat than does the deer-stalker on the bare hill-side.\n",
      "The melancholy of the book-hunter is aroused by two questions, “Whence?” and “Whither?” The bibliophile asks about his books the question which the metaphysician asks about his soul.\n",

      "His younger brother John was not without talent, as is clear from his work for Somervile’s “Chace,” 1796, and that highly edifying book, the “Blossoms of Morality.” Many of the tail-pieces to the “Water Birds” were designed by Robert Johnson, who also did most of the illustrations to Bewick’s “Fables” of 1818, which were engraved by Temple and Harvey, two other pupils.\n",

      "If we were to subdivide the species book collector into its various classes, the top-most rank in the whole subtle and capricious family should without doubt be given to the bibliophile.\n",
      "[Illustration] The bibliophile is a man endowed with a certain amount of intelligence and taste, who derives pleasure from works of genius, imagination, and feeling.\n",
      "He enjoys his mute conversations with great minds――unilateral conversations which can be begun at will, dropped without discourtesy, and resumed without insistence; and, from this love of the absent author whose words have been made known to him through the device of writing, he comes insensibly to love the material symbol in which those words are clothed.\n",
      "His feeling for the book is like the love of one friend for another’s portrait, or of the lover for the portrait of his mistress; and, like the lover, he wants the loved object to look its best.\n",
      "Alexander was a bibliophile.\n",
      "His son, Henri II, entrusted the secret of his love cipher to the magnificent bindings in his library, just as he did to the sumptuous decoration of his palaces.\n",
      "Even more remarkable――finance itself once showed a love for books.\n",
      "Alas, the bibliophile is no longer to be found in the upper classes of our _progressive_ society (I ask your pardon for the adjective, but it will have to stand, by your leave, along with the verb _to progress_); the bibliophile of the present day is the scholar, the man of letters, the artist, the small independent proprietor or the man of moderate fortune, who finds in dealing with books some relief from the boredom and insipidity of dealing with other men, and who is, to some extent, consoled for the deceptive nature of the other affections by a taste which, though perhaps misplaced, is at least innocent.\n",
      "I know one bibliophile of this sort (and could tell you his name if I chose) who has spent fifty years of his hardworking life in building up a library, and in selling his library in order to live.\n",
      "There is a bibliophile for you, and I warn you that he is one of the last of the species.\n",
      "Today, it is love of money that prevails; books no longer offer the slightest interest.\n",
      "The opposite of the bibliophile is the bibliophobe.\n",
      "It is rascals like this who prepared the Revolution.” “For my part,” he added, twisting somewhat coquettishly his gray moustache, “Heaven can witness that I have never read a single one of them!” The distinguishing marks of the bibliophile are the taste, the delicate and resourceful tact, which he applies to everything, and which contribute an inexpressible charm to life.\n",
      "One might even be so bold as to warrant that the bibliophile is to all intents and purposes a happy man, or at least that he knows how happiness can be achieved.\n",

      "Still, I am not sure that I would not be equally glad to own the volume of _Théagènes et Cariclée_[10] which Racine laughingly turned over to his professor with the words: “You can burn that; I know it by heart.” If that pretty little book is now no longer on the _quais_, with its elegant signature and the Greek notes in miniature characters which would identify it among a thousand others, I can guarantee that it once sojourned there.\n",

      "Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, President of The Bibliophile Society, aptly describes a miserly bibliomaniac as a Victim of a frenzied passion, He is lean and lank and crusty; Naught he cares for dress or fashion And his rusty coat smells musty; while in characterizing the natural impulses of true bibliophilism, he says that Bibliophiles take pride in showing All the gems of their collections; They are generous in bestowing, They have genuine affections.\n",

      "In Dibdin's Bibliomaniacal romance, \"Philemon\" is credited with the following narrative concerning one who was probably a bibliomaniac in all that the compound sense of the term implies:-- \"You all know my worthy friend Ferdinand, a very _helluo librorum_.\n",
      "He rose at five, walked in the meadows till seven, returned and breakfasted, stole upstairs to take a farewell peep at his beloved _Morte d'Arthur_, sighed 'three times and more,' paid his reckoning, apologized for the night's adventure, told the landlady he would shortly come and visit her again and try to pay his respects to the anonymous old gentleman.\n",
      "While these more opulent victims of book-madness vie with one another in the auction-room, the rational bibliophile sits in the gallery and views with silent awe and amazement the scrimmage over some apparently trifling volume that wouldn't fetch ten cents, but for the fact that it is \"unique,\" and that so and so paid a stupendous sum for it at some previous sale.\n",
      "Despair not, dear bibliophile, of never being able to join in the mad scramble for these \"uniques;\" nor need you feel that they are essential to the formation of a library.\n",
      "They possess no virtues perceptible to the ordinary bibliophile, and it requires all the eloquence of a Cicero to elucidate their charms when displaying them to friends.\n",
      "In referring to this class of book-buyers, Roswell Field says, \"The book-lover, so-called, who lacks any of the thrills that go with the _establishment_ as well as the enjoyment of a library in all of its appointments has deprived himself of many of the most pleasurable literary and semi-literary emotions.\n",
      "That bibliophile never pats his horse or his dog.\n",
      "In an article written for The Bibliophile Society's (1903) Year Book, Caroline Ticknor says, \"The true book-lover loves his books for their helpfulness, for their companionship; but he regards them as well for their elegant settings.\"\n",
      "Many of the most delightful persons, well read and competent to discourse intelligently upon the merits of books and authors, have never experienced a single pulsation of true bibliophilism; they have never known the joy of possessing and admiring a beautiful book, and that the attachment one bears for such a treasure is wholly reciprocal.\n",

      "Southey thus immortalizes his speechless, yet beloved, library companions: My never failing friends are they, With whom I converse day by day.\n",
      "But again, there is another extreme, for I once read a book issued under the misleading title of \"Pleasures of a Book-collector,\" or something of the sort, which might have been more appropriately called the \"Pleasures of a Single Man,\" seeing that the work had more to do with the hero's hopeless love for a fair damsel, and his hours at clubs, cafés, and other places of amusement in which I had no special interest, than it did with the acquirement of literature.\n",
      "Another and more palpable fraud has been perpetrated in copying the name of The Bibliophile Society, but with a slight prefix, just enough to afford a loop-hole through which to escape legal prosecution.\n",
      "A true bibliophile always feels a just pride in shelving one of these book-treasures of his own club's production, and thereafter displaying it before his friends, with the interesting bit of information that \"This is the latest production of _our Club_; it is issued _only for members_.\"\n",
      "For obviously an owner's interest in any work is increased many fold by the fact that he is a constituent part of the organization which produced the same: the relationship to the book in such a case is akin to the love of a parent for a child; and the owner of a fine library will not unusually regard his Club publications and privately printed books as the objects therein which are entitled to his fondest consideration.\n",
      "During the past few years it has been my pleasant privilege to spend many hours of each week in concurrent labor with the Council in the preparation of the publications of The Bibliophile Society, in which Council I have had the honor to serve continuously since its organization.\n",
      "I now realize as never before why it is that our busiest men of affairs, and scholars of renown, are actuated to serve so assiduously in this labor of love; for surely no amount of effort, however laborious, can be regarded as having been in any sense misguided or wasted when it elicits such approbation as expressed in the following letter from Charles A.

      "Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey were submissive victims of the bibliomania.\n",
      "As late as 1843, Dibdin remarks that \"it is a remarkable circumstance, that the bibliomania has almost uniformly confined its attacks to the _male_ sex, and among people in the higher and middling classes of society.\n",
      "It has raged chiefly in palaces, castles, halls, and gay mansions, and those things which in general are supposed not to be inimical to health,--such as cleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour, are only so many inducements to the introduction and propagation of the bibliomania!\"\n",

      "It is, however, a harmless insanity, and even in its worst stages it injures no one.\n",
      "People usually have a horror of insane persons, and one might well beware of indulging a taste for books, if there were any reasonable probability that this would lead to mental derangement.\n",
      "There could be furniture-maniacs, rug-maniacs, and china-maniacs just as well as book-maniacs, but people do not generally hesitate to purchase furniture, rugs, and china for fear of going crazy on the subject, and no more reason is there why rational persons should hesitate to make a collection of good books for a library, for fear of being called bibliomaniacs.\n",
      "In _Sesame and Lilies_ Ruskin says: \"If a man spends lavishly on his library, you call him mad--a bibliomaniac.\n",

      "In his _Bibliomania_ Dibdin enumerates eight symptoms of this \"darling passion or insanity,\" in the following order: \"A passion for large-paper copies, uncut copies, extra-illustrated copies, unique copies, copies printed on vellum, first editions, true editions, and black-letter copies.\"\n",
      "The first of these should be omitted from the symptomatic category: it would be fallacy to assume that one is a maniac because one admires the ample margins and paramount qualities of these large-paper copies, which Dibdin himself says are \"printed upon paper of a larger dimension and superior quality than the ordinary copies.\n",
      "He adds that \"this symptom of the bibliomania is at the present day both general and violent.\"\n",
      "The third \"symptom\" defined by Dibdin, viz: \"extra-illustrating,\" commonly called _grangerizing_, is really so far removed from the indicative stages of bibliomania as to render it entirely inappropriate as a proper single characteristic; it is the whole disease in its worst form.\n",

      "THE RULES OF THE CHASE IX.\n",
      "We might, for instance, trace, by the aid of Boswell, many of the books mentioned in it to the very hand of the master himself.\n",
      "When the delight of the chase was over, he recompensed her to the full market value, thereby proving that, in his case at least, a greed for books does not necessarily carry with it a stifled conscience.\n",
      "In his wanderings abroad he must many a time be painfully conscious of the fact that his own quest is that of everyone else whose tastes are similar to his own.\n",
      "Let a first edition of the immortal ’Angler’ so much as peep from among the grease and filth of a rag-and-bone shop, and a magnetic current travels at lightning speed to the homes of a score or more of pickers-up of unconsidered trifles, who forthwith race for the prize.\n",
      "The path of the book-hunter is trodden flat and hard with countless footsteps, and this is the reason why it is so unsatisfactory to look specially for anything valuable.\n",
      "And these comparisons will perhaps be very odious, for they will necessarily appeal directly to the cupidity of every bookworm that breathes, to every book-hunter who prowls around in search of rarities, and returns home—empty handed.\n",
      "The first book brought to the hammer at this sale; the preliminary bombshell which, to pursue Dibdin’s metaphor, was the signal for a furious cannonade, consisted of the ’Biblia Sacra Græca,’ printed by Aldus in 1518.\n",
      "It brought £4 15s., and any book-hunter might heartily pray for half a dozen copies now, on the same terms, for the present auction value runs to about six times as much.\n",
      "From a pecuniary point of view it would perhaps pay some rich book-hunter of the Lenox type to buy up everything of the kind he could lay his hands on, though the worst of speculations such as these is that the interest on the money invested has a tendency to swell the principal, and so to add enormously to the original cost.\n",
      "The twelve pages devoted to the enumeration of works of chivalry and romance glow with the martial achievements of Palmerin of England, Godeffroy de Boulion, Perceforest, Roy de la Grande Bretaigne, Perceval le Galleys, and scores of other champions who went about rescuing damsels in distress, sleeping in enchanted castles, and challenging the whole civilized race of men, one at a time, to mortal combat.\n",
      "It would be more than tedious to pursue this comparative analysis further.\n",
      "* The book-hunter whose heart is in his quest never tires of tales of lucky discoveries, and of rare books bought for a song.\n",
      "It is each man for himself, and that perhaps is the reason why book-men of the old school invariably dressed in staid and sober black, like Sisters of Charity, to show the world at large that charity in matters that relate to their pursuit is dead.\n",
      "Like the literary man’s collection of stock phrases, which he uses with or without variation as occasion may require, and at judicious intervals, so these records of the chase strike us as being peculiarly liable to recur.\n",
      "Then there are stories of Resbecque, who had a nose for a book second to that of no hound for a fox, of Naude, Colbert, the great Pixerecourt, and many more.\n",
      "All old cookery-books, and not merely Mrs. Glasse’s famous work, are rare, because they are books of practical utility meant to be consulted in a republic of pots and pans, and grease and litter; but Mrs. Glasse’s guide is more desirable than most other English books of the kind, because there is a sentiment hanging around it like a halo, by reason of words which are not to be found therein, ’First catch your hare.’ For my part, whenever I see a cookery-book flaunting it on a street barrow, I rescue it at once, for I have a belief, rightly or wrongly, that some of these days there will be a very great demand for old works of the kind.\n",
      "And if this particular book, why not many others, which, though not absolutely lost, are yet so very rarely met with that it is the ambition of every book-hunter, great or small, to track them down?\n",
      "So also the great Baxter reaped much renown by reason of his seventy folios or quartos, causing Bayle to remark, ’Perhaps no copying clerk who ever lived to grow old amidst the dust of an office ever transcribed so much as this author has written.’ The real book-hunter of to-day is, however, fortunately free of the ancient superstition, and knows very well that as a general rule the scarcest printed books are those which are small in size.\n",
      "I took the greatest pains to trace every step in the history I am about to unfold, and know that the details are true.\n",
      "They say that strange psychological influences often work out the destiny of men, although they know it not, and some such influence must have been haunting me then, for contrary to all custom, and notwithstanding the fact that to catch the last post was a matter of imperative necessity, I found that the catalogue had an altogether exceptional if not unique attraction.\n",
      "To sit there in reality I could not for shame, so I walked about Oxford Street within bowshot, ready to besiege the door in case any other snapper-up of unconsidered trifles should show an anxiety to forestall his brethren of the chase.\n",
      "’Yes,’ he replied, ’sold yesterday.’ I thought at the time that a trace of a smile played about the corners of his mouth as he said this, and I should not wonder if that were so, for the bookseller afterwards told me that his place had been besieged for many days by hungry bookworms, who had sauntered in one after the other in the most careless manner imaginable, and asked for this very ’Waltz.’ ’They positively danced on the pavement,’ he said, ’when they found it had gone,’ and with this small joke he was fain to mollify himself, for it was the literal truth that in an evil moment he had sold a pearl of great price for the beggarly sum of 3s.\n",
      "The real book-hunter does not follow the Directory, but his nose, which frequently leads him into strange places where there are no recognised booksellers, yet booksellers in plenty—a seeming paradox, which is readily explained by the fact that there are multitudes of what may, without offence, be called ’book-jobbers,’ whose names are either not in the Directory at all, or appear there under some other designation.\n",
      "The lordly collector who pays by cheque may or may not be a book-hunter.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Osborne prospered exceedingly, and in the latter years of his life was the owner of a country house and ’dog and duck shootings,’ all purchased and kept up from the profits derived from this shop in Gray’s Inn Lane.\n",
      "Mr. W. Roberts, in his charming ’Book-hunter in London,’ narrates that Collier once picked up in Holywell Street for the merest trifle a copy of John Hughes’s ’Calypso and Telemachus,’ an opera in three acts, first published in 1712, which contained thirty-eight unpublished couplets in the handwriting of Pope.\n",
      "This chapter is devoted to the ’Hunting-grounds’ of London, and I deny that a collector who gives a standing order either verbally or by letter to a bookseller for some work he particularly wants is a book-hunter at all, at least so far as that particular transaction is concerned.\n",
      "To my mind Nimrod must handle his own bow and not entrust it to a deputy, even though he might by the rules of the chase be absolutely entitled to the quarry which the skill of the latter had brought down.\n",
      "Let him go where he will, East or West, the point of the compass makes no matter, he is a hunter only when he prosecutes his own inquiries and carries out in person all his arrangements.\n",
      "So we will avoid the great firms of book-sellers, although it may be taken for granted that almost any scarce work could be procured sooner or later from them, and go off on a chase in which we shall never, in all human probability, meet with any great prize, and may have to be satisfied with a little, that little, however, being much from many points of view.\n",
      "The book-hunter of the present day has his foibles, it is true, but he has learned by experience and from the expostulatory remarks of others that wild freaks are completely out of place in a library, and so it has come to pass that books are treated in a different way from what they were only a couple of decades ago, and no one who has the smallest respect either for himself or his vocation would now either care or dare to form a collection of title-pages.\n",
      "This library is, of its kind, perhaps as important as any that has ever been formed, and yet it only numbers some 250 volumes, so supremely difficult is it, as a rule, to trace the possession even of books for more than a generation or two.\n",
      "After all, it is this motive that must be primarily considered in all ethical questions such as those which underlie, to some extent at least, the vagaries of every book-hunter who ever was born to hunger and thirst for Caxton’s types, and paper white as snow, bound in a dream by the Gascon’s magic touch.\n",
      "Men there were, as I have said, in plenty, who refused to quit the time-honoured traditions of their race; but on every side of them were being born lighter spirits, to whom colossal and intricate volumes were as heavy as lead.\n",
      "* *THE RULES OF THE CHASE.\n",

      "Rare things and precious, as manuscripts were before the invention of typography, are well preserved, but when the printing press was invented and paper books were multiplied in the earth; when libraries increased and readers were many, then familiarity bred contempt; books were packed in out-of-the-way places and neglected, and the oft-quoted, though seldom seen, bookworm became an acknowledged tenant of the library, and the mortal enemy of the bibliophile.\n",

      "Poets wrote humorous verse, and artists who justly held their time as too precious to permit of their working for love decorated the pages of the Bibliotaph’s scrap-books.\n",

      "For the Bibliotaph was once with a newly-married man, and they two met another man, who, as the conversation proceeded, disclosed the fact that he also had but recently been wed. Whereupon the first bridegroom, marveling that there could be another in the world so exalted as himself, exclaimed with sympathetic delight, ‘And you, too, are married.’ ‘Yes,’ said the second, ‘pleasant, isn’t it?’ with much the same air that he would have said, ‘Nice afternoon.’ This was one of the incidents which made the Bibliotaph skeptical about marriage.\n",
      "For example, in Leask’s Life of Boswell is an account of that curious little romance entitled Dorando.\n",
      "So vividly did he portray the marvels of that compound of thirst and scholarship that no one had the heart to laugh when, after one of his narrations, a gentleman asked the Bibliotaph if he himself had studied under Porson.\n",
      "Humor that does not meet this requirement is not likely, when its novelty has worn off, to be read even occasionally save by those who enjoy it as an intellectual performance or who are making a critical study of its author.’ The observation, if not profound, is at least sensible, and it illustrates very well the Bibliotaph’s love of alliteration and antithesis.\n",
      "This led a gentleman who was intimate with the Bibliotaph to say to him, ‘Why, if I were to pronounce that word among my kinsfolk as you do they’d think I was crazy.’ ‘What you mean,’ said the Bibliotaph, ‘is, that they would look upon it in the light of supererogatory supplementary evidence.’ He himself indulged overmuch in alliteration, but it was with humorous intent; and critics forgave it in him when they would have reprehended it in another.\n",
      "He arrived late one evening at the house of a friend where he was always heartily welcome, and before answering the chorus of greetings, proceeded to kiss the lady of the mansion, a queenly and handsome woman.\n",
      "Being asked why he—who was a large man and very shy with respect to women, as large men always are—should have done this thing, he answered that the kiss had been sent by a common friend and that he had delivered it at once, ‘for if there was anything he prided himself upon it was a courageous discharge of an unpleasant duty.’ Once when he had been narrating this incident he was asked what reply the lady had made to so uncourteous a speech.\n",
      "This led him to say apropos of an obscure critic who had assailed one of the poetical masters: ‘When the Lord makes a man a fool he injures him; but when He so constitutes him that the man is never happy unless he is making that fact public, He insults him.’ He enjoyed speculating on the subject of marriage, especially in the presence of those friends who unlike himself knew something about it empirically.\n",
      "He delighted to tell his lady acquaintances that their husbands would undoubtedly marry a second time if they had the chance.\n",
      "A man whose experience has been fortunate is bound to marry again, because he is like the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo.\n",
      "The Bibliotaph then added with a smile: ‘I have the idea that many men who marry a second time do in effect what is often done by unsuccessful gamblers at Monte Carlo; they go out and commit suicide.’ The Bibliotaph played but few games.\n",
      "He made a grotesque figure upon the court, with his big frame which must stoop mightily to take account of balls and short-handled mallets, with his agile manner, his uncovered head shaggy with its barbaric profusion of hair (whereby some one was led to nickname him Bibliotaph Indetonsus), with the scanty black alpaca coat in which he invariably played—a coat so short in the sleeves and so brief in the skirt that the figure cut by the wearer might almost have passed for that of Mynheer Ten Broek of many-trowsered memory.\n",
      "He has an intimate acquaintance with an immense number of interesting things.\n",
      "‘Winterbourne’s fingers were endowed with a gentle conjurer’s touch in spreading the roots of each little tree, resulting in a sort of caress under which the delicate fibres all laid themselves out in their proper direction for growth.’ Marty declared that the trees began to ‘sigh’ as soon as they were put upright, ‘though when they are lying down they don’t sigh at all.’ Winterbourne had never noticed it.\n",
      "According to a distinguished philosopher, wit and humor produce love.\n",
      "Certainly he paints these people with affectionate fidelity.\n",
      "Hardy would be sure of a reputation for pessimism in some quarters if only because of his attitude, or what people think is his attitude, toward marriage.\n",
      "He is considerably interested in questions of ‘matrimonial divergence.’ He recognizes that most obvious of all obvious truths, that marriage is not always a success; nay, more than this, that it is often a makeshift, an apology, a pretense.\n",
      "Her father has hoped that she will marry her rustic lover, Giles Winterbourne, who, by the way, is a man in every fibre of his being.\n",
      "For the motive which brings the girl back to her husband is only a more complex phase of the same motive which chiefly prompted her to marry him.\n",
      "Hardy says that Fitzspiers as a lover acted upon Grace ‘like a dram.’ His presence ‘threw her into an atmosphere which biased her doings until the influence was over.’ Afterward she felt ‘something of the nature of regret for the mood she had experienced.’ But this same story contains two other characters who are unmatched in fiction as the incarnation of pure love and self-forgetfulness.\n",
      "He never knows of Marty’s love.\n",
      "After all, a book in which unselfish love is described in terms at once just and noble cannot be dangerously pessimistic, even if it also takes cognizance of such hopeless cases as a man with a chronic tendency to fluctuations of the heart.\n",

      "He could even urge his friend Reynolds to talk about it to him, much as one might beg a trusted friend to talk about one’s lady-love, and with the confidence that only the fitting thing would be spoken.\n",
      "If he had had any terrible heart-burning over their malignancy, if he had felt that his life was poisoned, he could hardly have forborne some allusion to it in his letters to his brother, George Keats.\n",
      "But you may see young men pledging their mutual love and support in this difficult and adventurous quest of what is noblest in the art of living.\n",
      "Such love will not urge to a theatrical posing, and it can hardly find expression in words.\n",
      "He was charming in his attitude toward Haydon; and when Haydon proposed sending Keats’s sonnet to Wordsworth, the young poet wrote, ‘The Idea of your sending it to Wordsworth put me out of breath—you know with what Reverence I would send my well wishes to him.’ But interesting as a chapter on Keats’s friendships with men would be, we are bound to confess that in dramatic intensity it would grow pale when laid beside that fiery love passage of his life, his acquaintance with Fanny Brawne.\n",
      "The thirty-nine letters given in the fourth volume of Buxton Forman’s edition of Keats’s Works tell the story of this affair of a poet’s heart.\n",
      "The man who takes upon himself the responsibility of being the first to open such intimate letters, and adds thereto the infinitely greater responsibility of publishing them in so attractive a form that he who runs will stop running in order to read,—such an editor will need to satisfy Mr. Watson that in so doing he was not listening at a keyhole or spying over a wall.\n",
      "I, for one, wish that great men would not leave their love letters around.\n",
      "But why one who reads the letters of Keats to Fanny Brawne should have any other feeling than that of pity for a poor fellow who was so desperately in love as to be wretched because of it I do not see.\n",
      "He had a complacent boyish superiority of attitude with respect to all those who are weak enough to love women.\n",
      "‘Nothing,’ he says, ‘strikes me so forcibly with a sense of the ridiculous as love.\n",
      "A man in love I do think cuts the sorryest figure in the world.\n",
      "In a much earlier letter than this he hopes he shall never marry, but nevertheless has a good deal to say about a young lady with fine eyes and fine manners and a ‘rich Eastern look.’ He discovers that he can talk to her without being uncomfortable or ill at ease.\n",
      "George Eliot says of Gwendolen Harleth that there was ‘a certain fierceness of maidenhood in her,’ which expression is quoted here only to emphasize the girl’s feeling towards men as described a little later, when Rex Gascoigne attempted to tell her his love.\n",
      "It is easy to see from the letters that Keats was a difficult lover.\n",
      "Hard to please at the best, his two sicknesses, one of body and one of heart, made him whimsical.\n",
      "For these reasons it happens that the letters at times come very near to being documents in love-madness.\n",
      "Many a line in them gives sharp pain, as a record of heart-suffering must always do.\n",
      "You may read Richard Steele’s love letters for pleasure, and have it.\n",
      "The love letters of Keats scorch and sting; and the worst of it is that you cannot avoid reflecting upon the transitory character of such a passion.\n",
      "Withering young love like this does not last.\n",
      "To pronounce upon this romance is not easy.\n",
      "The hero, Euphues, who gives the title to the romance, is a young, clever, and rich Athenian.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the old gentleman has the righteous energy which prompts him to say to the departing Euphues, already out of hearing, ‘Seeing thou wilt not buy counsel at the first hand good cheap, thou shalt buy repentance at the second hand, at such unreasonable rate, that thou wilt curse thy hard pennyworth, and ban thy hard heart.’ Euphues takes to himself a new sworn brother, one Philautus, who carries him to visit his lady-love, Lucilla.\n",
      "In fact, she unceremoniously throws over her former lover, and tells her father that she will either marry Euphues or else lead apes in hell.\n",
      "This causes a break in the friendship between Euphues and Philautus, and there is an exchange of formidably worded letters, in which Philautus reminds Euphues that all Greeks are liars, and Euphues quotes Euripides to the effect that all is lawful in love.\n",
      "Both profess themselves to have been fools, while Euphues, as the greater and more recent fool, composes a pamphlet against love.\n",
      "This he calls a ‘cooling-card.’ It is addressed primarily to Philautus, but contains general advice for ‘all fond lovers.’ Euphues’s own cure was radical, for he says, ‘Now do I give a farewell to the world, meaning rather to macerate myself with melancholy, than pine in folly, rather choosing to die in my study amidst my books than to court it in Italy in the company of ladies.’ He returns to Athens, applies himself to the study of philosophy, becomes public reader in the University, and, as crowning evidence that he has finished sowing his wild oats, produces three volumes of lectures.\n",
      "The story, including the diatribe against love, is about as long as The Vicar of Wakefield.\n",
      "It begins as a romance and ends as a sermon.\n",
      "In London the two travelers become favorites at the court.\n",
      "Philautus falls in love, to the great annoyance of Euphues, who argues mightily with him against such folly.\n",
      "They quarrel violently, and Euphues becomes so irritated that he must needs go and rent new lodgings, ‘which by good friends he quickly got, and there fell to his Pater noster, where awhile,’ says Lyly innocently, ‘I will not trouble him in his prayers.’ They are reconciled later, and Philautus obtains permission to love; but he has discovered in the mean time that the lady will not have him.\n",
      "The account of his passion, how it ‘boiled and bubbled,’ of his visit to the soothsayer to purchase love charms, his stately declamations to Camilla and her elaborate replies to him, of his love letter concealed in a pomegranate, and her answer stitched into a copy of Petrarch,—is all very lively reading, much more so than that dreary love-making between Pyrocles and Philoclea, or between any other pair of the many exceedingly tiresome folk in Sidney’s Arcadia.\n",
      "It is not to be supposed that a clever eighteen-year-old girl, replying to a declaration of love, will talk in the language of a trained nurse, and say: ‘Green sores are to be dressed roughly lest they fester, tettars are to be drawn in the beginning lest they spread, Ringworms to be anointed when they first appear lest they compass the whole body, and the assaults of love to be beaten back at the first siege lest they undermine at the second.’ Was ever suitor in this fashion rejected!\n",
      "But Philautus does not break his heart over Camilla’s rejection.\n",
      "He is consoled with the love of another fair maiden, marries her, and settles in England.\n",
      "Even that old gentleman of Naples who came first to Euphues because his heart bled to see so noble a youth given to loose living has the tables turned upon him, for Euphues preaches to the preacher upon the sovereign duty of resignation to the will of God.\n",
      "The ladies are provided with apt remarks drawn from the experiences of Helen, of Cornelia, of Venus, of Diana, and Vesta.\n",
      "Philautus, inflamed with love of Camilla, goes to his room and pronounces a ten-minute discourse on the pangs of love, having only himself for auditor.\n",
      "Euphues, angry with Philautus for having allowed himself to fall in love, takes him to task in a single speech containing four thousand words.\n",
      "Much of the seriousness in his romance is the burden of twenty-six years’ experience of life, a burden greater perhaps than he ever afterward carried.\n"

      "Euphues, besides being a treatise on love and education, is a sort of Tudor tract upon animated nature.\n",
      "We have had everything else; a story for who wanted a story, theories upon the education of children, a body of mythological divinity, a discussion of methods of public speaking, advice for men who are about to marry, a theological sparring match, in which a man of straw is set up to be knocked down, and is knocked down, a thousand illustrations of wit and curious reading, and now, as a thing that all men could understand, the author tells Englishmen of their own good fortune in being Englishmen, and is finely outspoken in praise of what he calls ‘the blessed Island.’ This is an old-fashioned vein, to be sure,—the ad captandum trick of a popular orator bent upon making a success.\n",

      "During the same time 60,000 children have been born in America.’ From these data Dr. Price is to calculate ‘the time and expense necessary to kill us all, and conquer the whole of our territory.’ Then the letter closes with greetings ‘to the club of honest whigs at the London Coffee House.’ Seven years later Franklin’s heart was still faithful to the club.\n",
      "He writes to Priestley from France: ‘I love you as much as ever, and I love all the honest souls that meet at the London Coffee House….\n",

      "But to Keats books were literature or they were not literature, and one cannot think that his affections would twine about ever so bookish a volume which was merely ‘curious.’ One reads with sympathetic amusement of Keats’s genuine and natural horror of paying the same bill twice, ‘there not being a more unpleasant thing in the world (saving a thousand and one others).’ The necessity of preserving adequate evidence that a bill had been paid was uppermost in his thought quite frequently; and once when, at Leigh Hunt’s instance, sundry packages of papers belonging to that eminently methodical and businesslike man of letters were to be sorted out and in part destroyed, Keats refused to burn any, ‘for fear of demolishing receipts.’ But the reader will chance upon few more humorous passages than that in which the poet tells his brother George how he cures himself of the blues, and at the same time spurs his flagging powers of invention: ‘Whenever I find myself growing vaporish I rouse myself, wash and put on a clean shirt, brush my hair and clothes, tie my shoe-strings neatly, and, in fact, adonize, as if I were going out—then all clean and comfortable, I sit down to write.\n",
      "‘I find I cannot exist without Poetry,—without eternal Poetry; half the day will not do,—the whole of it; I began with a little, but habit has made me a leviathan.’ He tells Leigh Hunt, in a letter written from Margate, that he thought so much about poetry, and ‘so long together,’ that he could not get to sleep at night.\n",

      "Dibdin, weighting himself with more than his usual burden of ponderous jocularity, set himself in motion to intimate to Scott the desire of the club that the Author of Waverley, with whom it was supposed that he had the means of communicating, would accept of the seat at the club vacated by the death of Sir Mark Sykes.\n",

      "In Scott's acknowledgment of the contribution, printed also in the Life of Surtees, there are some words that must have brought misgivings and fear of detection to the heart of the culprit, since Scott, without apparently allowing doubts to enter his mind, yet marked some peculiarities in the piece, in which it differed from others.\n",
      "In the very same letter, quoted above, where Scott acknowledges the treacherous gift, he also acknowledges the hints he has received; and, mentioning the Highland stories he had imbibed from old Stewart of Invernahyle, says: \"I believe there never was a man who united the ardour of a soldier and tale-teller—or man of talk, as they call it in Gaelic—in such an excellent degree; and as he was as fond of telling as I was of hearing, I became a violent Jacobite at the age of ten years old; and even since reason and reading came to my assist[307]ance, I have never got rid of the impression which the gallantry of Prince Charles made on my imagination.\n",

      "This is a long proemium to the description of his characteristics as a book-hunter—but these can be briefly told.\n",

      "His pursuit, indeed, was like that of the savage who seeks but to appease the hunger of the moment.\n",
      "If he catch a prey just sufficient for his desires, it is well; yet he will not hesitate to bring down the elk or the buffalo, and, satiating himself with the choicer delicacies, abandon the bulk of the carcass to the wolves or the vultures.\n",
      "Before passing to another and the last case, I propose to say a word or two on some of the minor specialties which characterise the pursuit in its less amiable or dignified form.\n",
      "He is said not long to have survived this practical joke; and one does not wonder at his sinking before such a prospect, if he anticipated an age and a race of book-buyers among whom his great critical works are forgotten, and his name is known solely for the spurious volume, sacred to infamy, which may be found side by side with the works of the author of Trimalcion's Feast—\"par nobile fratrum.\"\n",

      "There is another peculiar, and, it may be said, vicious propensity, exhibited occa[54]sionally in conjunction with the pursuit.\n",
      "This spirit is said to burn with still fiercer flame in the breasts of those whose pursuit would externally seem to be the most innocent in the world, and the least excitive of the bad passions—namely, among flower-fanciers.\n",
      "From some mysterious cause, it has been known to develop itself most flagrantly among tulip-collectors, insomuch that there are legends of Dutch devotees of this pursuit who have paid their thousands of dollars for a duplicate tuber, that they might have the satisfaction of crushing it under the heel.\n",
      "[28] This line of practice is not entirely alien to the book-hunter.\n",
      "There are such not only among very old books, but among very new; for of a certain class of modern books it frequently happens that a copy or two may be printed on vellum, to catch the class whose weakness takes that direction.\n",
      "Collectors there have been, not unimportant for number and zeal, whose mission it is to purchase books marked by peculiar mistakes or errors of the press.\n",
      "And although he was a confirmed book-hunter, and not unconscious of the merits of the peculiar class of books now under consideration, it may be feared that it was no consolation to him to reflect that, some century or so hence, his books and himself would be known only by the curious blunder which made one of them worth the notice of the book-fanciers.\n",
      "That mysterious body called compositors, through whose hands all literature passes, are reputed to be a placid and unimpressionable race of practical stoics, who do their work dutifully, without yielding to the intellectual influences represented by it.\n",

      "The difference between these is something like, in the sporting world, that between the stalker and the hunter proper.\n",
      "There is wild work sometimes there, and men find themselves carried off by enthusiasm and competition towards pecuniary sacrifices which at the threshold of the temple they had solemnly[89] vowed to themselves to eschew.\n",
      "But such sacrifices are the tribute paid to the absorbing interest of the pursuit, and are looked upon in their own peculiar circle as tending to the immortal honour of those who make them.\n",
      "The great passion and pursuit of his life having been of so peculiar a character—he was almost as zealous a hunter of deer and wild swans, by the way, as of books, but this was not considered in the least peculiar—it was necessary to find some strange influencing motive for his conduct; so it has been said that it arose from his having been crossed in love in his early youth.\n",
      "Scott attributed to an incidental occurrence at his father's table the direction given to the great pursuit of his life.\n",
      "It so happened that the Duke remembered this volume having been offered to him for £100, and he believed he could still trace and secure it: he did so, and laid it before his admiring friends at a subsequent sitting.\n",
      "Having devoted the preceding pages to the diagnosis of the book-hunter's condition, or, in other words, to the different shapes which the phenomena peculiar to it assume, I now propose to offer some account of his place in the dispensations of Providence, which will probably show that he is not altogether a mischievous or a merely useless member of the human family, but does in reality, however unconsciously to himself, minister in his own peculiar way to the service both of himself and others.\n",
      "As the judicious physician informs the patient suffering under some cutaneous or other external torture, that the poison lay deep in his constitution—that it must have worked in some shape—and well it is that it has taken one so innocuous—so may even the book-hunter be congratulated on having taken the innate moral malady of all the race in a very gentle and rather a salubrious form.\n",
      "To pass over gambling, tippling, and other practices which cannot be easily spoken of in good society, let us look to the other shapes in which man lets himself out—for instance to horse-racing, hunting, photography, shooting, fishing, cigars, dog-fancying, dog-fighting, the ring, the cockpit, phrenology, revivalism, socialism; which of these contains so small a balance of evil, counting of course that the amount of pleasure conferred is equal—for it is only on the datum that the book-hunter has as much satisfaction from his pursuit as the fox-hunter, the photographer, and so on, has in his, that a fair comparison can be struck?\n",
      "They leave little or nothing behind—even the photographer's portfolio will bring scarcely anything under the hammer after the death of him whose solace and pursuit it had been, should the positives remain visible, which may be doubted.\n",
      "But the book-hunter may possibly leave a little fortune behind him.\n",
      "A small sprinkling of these—even the chance of them—excites him, like the angler's bites and rises, and gives its zest to his pursuit.\n",
      "No doubt, a man may ruin himself by purchasing costly books, as by indulgence in any other costly luxury, but the chances of calamity are comparatively small in this pursuit.\n",
      "A thousand pounds will go a great way in book-collecting, if the collector be true to the traditions of his pursuit, such as they are to be hereafter expounded.\n",
      "The mercenary spirit must not be admitted to a share in the enjoyments of the book-hunter.\n",
      "If, after he has taken his last survey of his treasures, and spent his last hour in that quiet library, where he has ever found his chief solace against the wear and worry of the world, the book-hunter has been removed to his final place of rest, and it is then discovered that the circumstances of the family require his treasures to be dispersed,—if then the result should take the unexpected shape that his pursuit has not been so ruinously costly after all—nay, that his expenditure has actually fructified—it is well.\n",
      "But if the book-hunter allow money-making—even for those he is to leave behind—to be combined with his pursuit, it loses its fresh relish,[106] its exhilarating influence, and becomes the source of wretched cares and paltry anxieties.\n",
      "Having so put in a plea for this pursuit, as about the least costly foible to which those who can afford to indulge in foibles can devote themselves, one might descant on certain auxiliary advantages—as,[109] that it is not apt to bring its votaries into low company; that it offends no one, and is not likely to foster actions of damages for nuisance, trespass, or assault, and the like.\n",
      "But rather let us turn our attention to the intellectual advantages accompanying the pursuit, since the proper function of books is in the general case associated with intellectual culture and occupation.\n",
      "In fact, \"a course of reading,\" as it is sometimes called, is a course of regimen for dwarfing the mind, like the drugs which dog-breeders give to King Charles spaniels to keep them small.\n",
      "Peradventure the matter so perused suggests another passage in some other volume which it will be satisfactory and interesting to find, and so another and another search is made, while the hours pass by unnoticed, and the day seems all too short for the pursuit which is a luxury and an enjoyment, at the same time that it fills the mind with varied knowledge and wisdom.\n",
      "The fact is that the book-hunter, if he be genuine, and have his heart in his pursuit, is also a reader and a scholar.\n",
      "[38] No one, therefore, can be an ardent follower of such a pursuit without having his own library.\n",

      "[60] Apart, however, from violence and accident, there is a constant decay of books from what might be called natural causes, keeping, like the decay of[212] the human race, a proportion to their reproduction, which varies according to place or circumstance; here showing a rapid increase where production outruns decay, and there a decrease where the morbid elements of annihilation are stronger than the active elements of reproduction.\n",

      "Among these I would chiefly be inclined to affect the company of Peignot,[240] whose wild and wayward course of reading provides for you something like to a ramble over the mountains with an Alpine hunter, the only kind of guide to whom the thorough pedestrian wanderer should give up his freedom.\n",
      "To judge from the title-page, one might trace them as far back as 1676, in John Hallervord's Bibliotheca Curiosa, in which the editor professes to indicate many authors which are very rare and known to few; but this book would give no satisfaction to pure rarity seekers.\n",

      "Perhaps some ethnological philosopher will devote himself to the special investigation and development of the phenomenon; and if such things are done then in the way in which they are now, the result will appear in something like the following shape:— \"Man, as we pursue his destiny from century to century, is still found inevitably to resolve himself into a connected and antithetic series of consecutive cycles.\n"

      "The spring close by the dwelling or cell of the saint—the spring on account of which he probably selected the centre of his mission—had not only washed the forefathers of the district from the stain of primeval heathenism, but had applied the visible sign by which all, from generation to generation, had been admitted into the bosom of the Church.\n",

      "I do not know to whom Grose alludes; but it strikes me, in realising a man given to such propensities—taking them as a reality and not a joke—that it would be interesting to know how, in his moments of serious thought, he could contemplate his favourite pursuit—as, for instance, when the conscientious physician may have thought it necessary to warn him in time of the approaching end—how he could reckon up his good use of the talents bestowed on him, counting among them his opportunities for the encouragement of art as an elevator and improver of the human race.\n",

      "But the Sydneys of Penshurst, the Oxindens of Barham, the Lee-Warlys, the Barretts of Lee, the Evelyns of Sayes-Court and Wootton, and others among the gentry of these and the adjacent shires, probably filled their shelves in principal measure from the London shops during their periodical visits to the metropolis for various purposes.\n",
      "The seats of our two ancient Universities, and cathedral cities generally, have not yielded such ample fruit to the explorer, perhaps because there has always been a species of magnetic attraction, by which any spoils of the kind are drawn into the local libraries and museums.\n",
      "At the same time, the Universities and Inns of Court have been from time to time the homes of many famous book-collections.\n",
      "This undoubtedly wide-spread sentiment strikes a very serious blow at a pursuit in which the enthusiast meets with slight sympathy or encouragement, unless it is at the hands of the dealers, naturally bound for their own sakes to keep him in heart by sympathy and flattery.\n",
      "No one should be too positive whether it is to the rich or to the poor book-collector that the romantic element chiefly or more powerfully attaches itself.\n",
      "The love of the book without regard to the binding, or of the binding irrespectively of the book; the fashion for works with woodcuts, of certain printers, of certain places, of certain dates; the establishment of a fixed rule as to a subject or a group of subjects, taken up collectively or in succession; a limitation as to price or as to size, for a candidate for admittance to some cabinets may not exceed so many inches in altitude; it must go back to the century which produced it, to be rewritten or reprinted, ere it may have a place.\n",
      "A study of the writer's _Rolls of Book-Collectors_, which embrace over two thousand names, will satisfy any one that the hereditary or transmitted collections in this country are very few, if we limit ourselves to libraries of note, and do not compensate for the long catalogue of old libraries which have been dispersed even in our own time.\n",
      "At the same time, in a monograph of limited scope it is obviously impossible to embrace even a general view of the enormously wide range which is before any one who crosses over from his own country to add to his English possessions even a select collection of books in foreign languages; and we have confined our efforts in this direction to an indication of such typical or special works (principally French) as are usually sought by people in these islands, who resort more or less to the Continental market.\n",
      "A visit to a library such as the British Museum or the Bodleian, or even to those of some of the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, is apt to instil a feeling of reverential affection for the founders and benefactors of such institutions; the existing functionaries seem to withdraw into middle distance, and one enters into communion with the spirits of the departed.\n",
      "It was not till many years after the dispersion of that noble Harleian memorial of generous ardour among the public and private collections of England and the Continent (Dr. Johnson in his letter to Sir F. Barnard, 1768, says that many books passed direct into the _Bibliothèque du Roi_ at Paris), that the Shakespeare revival led to an inquiry, on the one hand, into the literature connected with the Elizabethan period, and on the other to a partial discovery of how much of it had perished.\n",
      "He showed me a delightful old volume of tracts, bound in a vellum wrapper, some absolutely unique, which his grandfather had bought, and a copy of the romance of _Richard Coeur de Lion_, 1509, which came out of a poor cottage in Lincolnshire.\n",
      "AS books, in a manuscript or printed shape, are far more numerous and varied than any other species of property, and are also more largely sought for purposes of direct study and instruction, there exists the greater difficulty in attempting to advise collectors as to the line which it is best, wisest, or safest to embrace.\n",
      "This group of literature has grown within the last twenty years almost unattainable by the less opulent bibliophile; its commercial value has risen to four times that to which the previous generation was accustomed.\n",
      "Pepys was rather smitten with those which appeared in and about his own time, and at Magdalen, Cambridge, with the rest of his library, a considerable number of them is bound up in volumes, lettered _Penny Merriments_ and _Penny Godlinesses_ respectively.\n",
      "For instance, Dyce, who laid a collateral stress on _Shakespeariana_; Ireland, who made himself strong in Leigh Hunt and Hazlitt; Crossley, who had a peculiar affection for Defoe; Bliss, who collected books of characters and books printed at Oxford or just before the Great Fire of 1666; Bandinel, who was smitten by the charms of the Civil War literature; Corser, whose bibliographical sweethearts were Nicholas Breton and Richard Brathwaite; and Rimbault, who had two, Old Music and Old Plays.\n",
      "It is nearly always the _lacunæ_ for which we yearn; one or two of our richer friends have them, and we have not.\n",
      "The man of the old school, who ransacked the shops and the stalls, and even attended the auction, may have been a faddist and a superficial student; but his was an honest sort of zeal and affection; there was no vanity or jealousy; and we meet with cases where one collector would surrender to another an acquisition which the latter happened to have missed, and to want very badly indeed.\n",
      "A considerable proportion of his shelf-furniture are distant acquaintances, as it were, and those acquisitions with which he is intimate are not unlikely to prove less numerous than the belongings of his humbler and less voracious contemporary.\n",
      "that I lacked any real essential, as the child tried to satisfy Longfellow that his shelves were not complete without a copy of the undying romance of Jack the Giant-killer.\n",
      "We have personally known cases where a publication by one of the early printers was first introduced to notice, and created a sort of sensation, as a mutilated fragment rescued from the binding of another work; this revelation brought to light, after an interval, a second of a different issue; anon at some auction occurred a perfect copy; and now the poor damaged worm-eaten leaves, once so reverently and so tenderly regarded, awake no further interest; the mystery and romance have vanished; and when we examine the book as a whole, we do not find its merits so striking as when we strained our eyes to decipher the old binder's pasteboard.\n",
      "A fragment of a small tract in verse by Lydgate, from the prolific press of Wynkyn de Worde, was proclaimed as an extraordinary and unique accession to our literary stores some eighty years since; it was called _The Treatise of a Gallant_, and had been taken from the covers of a volume of statutes in the library at Nash Court.\n",
      "Entire and large impressions of books, pamphlets, and broadsides have succumbed, not to the sacrilegious hand of the spoiler, but to the too affectionate, and not too cleanly, fingering of the multitude of men and women who read and then cast the sources of entertainment away.\n",
      "These episodes appertain to the romantic and speculative aspect of book-collecting; but they really have another side.\n",
      "For his Majesty's agent at the latter gave as much as £14 for the romance of _Paris and Vienne_, from the Caxton press, 1485.\n",
      "Early typography; early poetry and romances; books of hours; books of emblems; Roman Catholic literature; liturgies; Bewick; Bartolozzi; the first edition (which was sometimes equally the last); books on vellum, on India-paper, or on yellow or some other bizarre colour or material, debarring perusal of the publication; copies with remarkable blunders or with some of the text inadvertently omitted--all these and a legion of others have had their day; and to some of them it happens that they drop out of view for a season, and then reappear for a second or third brief term of life and favour; and therefore, it being so, who can have the heart to blame the parties that in the exercise of their vocation make hay while the sun shines?\n",
      "The bibliographical barometer is surprisingly sensitive, and the slightest change of fashion in the older literature, and even in those sections of the more recent which embrace acknowledged rarities, is instantaneously felt.\n",
      "THE entire range of the earlier English and Scotish romantic, poetical, and even historical literature embraces so many items, which are either unattainable from their rarity or their cost, if they happen once in a lifetime to occur, that it may be said to be ground almost closed against the ordinary private buyer.\n",
      "These publications embrace not merely religious and controversial literature, but a large and important body of material for English and Scotish biography and history, and for the elucidation of Irish affairs.\n",
      "The attempt on the part of a collector, however rich and persevering he might be, to form a complete series of original editions of the poetical and romantic writers of North Britain, could only be made in ignorance of the utter impossibility of success.\n"

      "It is true enough that one may form, not only a library, but a remarkably extensive one, of books of reference and study; but this does not quite answer to the idea of a bibliophile--in fact, it is little more than the digestion into book-form of a mass of learning and useful information.\n",
      "In the English series, independently of the woodcuts which incidentally occur in the books printed by Caxton and his immediate successors and the _Emblem_ series, there are Roeslin's _Birth of Mankind_, by Raynald, 1540, Braun's _Civitates Orbis Terrarum_, Gemini's _Anatomy_, 1545, Godet's _Genealogy of all the Kings of England_, 1563, Saxton's _Maps_, Holinshed's _Chronicles_, 1577, Harington's _Ariosto_, 1591, Holland's _Baziologia_, 1618, and _Heröologia_, 1620, the various works illustrated by Pass, Elstracke, Hollar, Barlow, and others, Vicars's _England's Worthies_, 1645, Ricraft's _Survey of England's Champions_, 1647, and other publications by Ricraft with engravings, till we come down to the pictorial histories of England by Bishop White, Kennett, and Rapin and Tindal, Pine's _Horace_, and Buck's _Views_.\n",
      "Pine's _Horace_, even in the first edition, 1733, with the _Post Est_ reading, is common enough; and it has been found uncut.\n",
      "The French, and we may perhaps add the Anglo-French school of book-collecting, works on lines which to a normal lover of books must at first appear rather mysterious and strange, if not absolutely irrational.\n",
      "One can understand, again, the enthusiasm for an unrecorded old poem, romance, or play, for a production by an eminent author supposed to have perished, or for a precious relic such as the Manesse MS., presented by the German Emperor Frederic to the library at Heidelberg, from which it had been taken by the French during the wars of the Revolution.\n",
      "WHAT may be treated as the casual accessories of books of nearly all periods and countries--the autograph inscription testifying to the ownership or signalising a gift from one possessor to another--have manifold and diversified elements of interest and attraction.\n",
      "notes in the writer's hand, if not with both; yet they invariably command a liberal price from the admission of Walton by common acknowledgment into the select circle of literary men, whose works we love for the sake of the author.\n",

      "The ornamental details of early bindings, especially those of Continental origin, embrace nearly every section of natural history: beasts, birds, fishes, insects, flowers, and fruit, and endless varieties of geometrical lines and curves.\n",
      "It is the binding which constitutes the supreme feature of importance and attraction.\n",
      "We may fairly consider, looking at the intimate relationship between Scotland and France in former times, that a certain proportion of volumes of Scotish origin were bound abroad, just as Americans at present send over their books to England.\n",
      "This personage was held in high esteem by his clients, and was very intimate with Smollett the novelist, who is said to have had Lewis in his mind, when he drew the character of Strap in _Roderick Random_.\n",
      "From the commencing years of the eighteenth century, in addition to the binders just enumerated, there is a fairly consecutive series, who worked for the court and the public: Padeloup, the two Deromes, Douceur (who was much employed by Madame de Pompadour), the two Bozérians, Le Monnier, Tessier, Dubuisson (famous for his gilding), Simier, Thompson of Paris, Capé, Duru, Chambolle, Lesne (who printed in 1827 a didactic poem on his craft), Trautz, Bauzonnet, Marius-Michel, and Lortic.\n",

      "The actual current appreciation of old books seems to be, to a large and increasing extent, in the ratio of their literary or artistic attraction; and under the second head we comprise typography and wood-engraving; and we think that we could establish that, as a rule, the highest bids in modern days are for something of which the reputation or importance, or both, are a matter of tacit acknowledgment and acceptance.\n",
      "The romance connected with the acquisition of the Grenville one has been more than once printed; but the _Chronicles of England_, from the same press, especially on vellum, maintains its reputation for the utmost rarity, although there were two impressions; and the same may be said of the issues by William of Mecklin, Caxton, and Gerard de Leeu, all and any of which could not, if complete, fail to command very high prices even on paper.\n",

      "CHAPTER V Voyages and travels--Their strong American interest--Maryland and Pennsylvania--New Plymouth--Sir John Mandeville--Columbus and Vespucci--Early medical literature--Harvey and the circulation of the blood--Occult literature--Phenomena--Technical works--The paddle-wheel--Books printed in a special manner--Chapbooks--Garlands--Ballads--Broadsides--Street advertisements--General or miscellaneous collections--Omnivorous buyers--Richard Heber, Sir Thomas Phillipps, James Crossley--A moral deduced--Most interesting types of collector--Advantages connected with restriction to personal tastes or wants--Dangers of emulation and servility--Mr. Quaritch's _Dictionary of Collectors_--Various sorts of genuine collector.\n",
      "_Occult Literature_ is susceptible of a division into several classes or sections: Religious Cults, Necromancy, Magic, Second Sight, Divination, Astrology, Palmistry, of which all have their special literatures and bibliographies.\n",
      "Setting aside the mere book of reference, which has to be multiplied to suit various exigencies, there may be said to be three classes of literary property which rationally appeal to our sympathy: (i) the volume which commends itself by its intrinsic value and charm; (ii) that which has grown dear from lengthened companionship and possibly hereditary link; (iii) and that which, unimportant so far as its internal claims and merits are concerned, bears on its face the evidence of having once belonged to a favourite of our own or a world's hero.\n",
      "One man prefers the modern novelists, prose essayists, or verse writers; a second, collections of caricatures and prints in book-form; a third, topography; a fourth, the occult sciences, and so forth.\n",
      "They may be the best editions by the best binders, or they may be antiquarian periodicals or sets of Learned Transactions, reducing much of the elder lore cherished and credited by our ancestors to waste-paper; we feel that it is a sort of superstition which influences us in regarding them; but we fail to shake off the prejudice, or whatever it may be, and we hold up, on the contrary, to the gaze of some sceptical acquaintance a humble little volume in plain mellow sheep--say, a first Walton, or Bunyan, or Carew, nay, by possibility a Caxton or Wynkyn de Worde--which a roomful of perfectly gentlemanly books should not buy from us.\n",
      "All these equally tell you, not what some one else saw or thought, but what they saw or thought themselves, and in a manner which will never cease to charm.\n",
      "The secret and the charm seems to lie in the fact that all great books are pictures of human nature, which is and has been always the same; and we are able to account in a similar manner for the stupendous popularity of such works as the _Imitatio Christi_ and the _Pilgrim's Progress_.\n",
      "You know that much is obsolete, and other men have improved on them; but there is somehow the same charm.\n",
      "We have all heard of the _Hundred Merry Tales_, rescued by Mr. Conybeare in the early years of the century from another book, of which the fragments assisted to form the covers, and how the treasure was prized till a complete copy occurred in a Continental library and dispelled the charm.\n",
      "The ordinary copies of this work, of which the whole charm lies in the meretricious plates by Eisen (for the text is inoffensive enough), are distinguished by the presence or otherwise of two or three plates in a particular state, those left as originally printed being preferred, because they offer certain unconventional details subsequently modified.\n",
      "The question depends on the donor, or the recipient, or the article given and received; and where all these combine to augment the charm and to complete the spell, the issue is electrifying.\n",
      "CHAPTER XII Materials on which books are printed--Early popular works printed on vellum--The _edition de luxe_ again--Binding of books--Earliest method and style--Printers who were also binders--Superiority of morocco to russia and calf--Influence of climate and atmosphere on bindings--Character of old English bindings--Charm of a Caxton or other precious volume in the original covers--A first folio Shakespeare in old calf--Our latter-day literature compared with the old--Splendour of the liveries of books in the libraries of France under the ancient régime--Disappointment at the interiors of well-bound volumes explained--The author plays a subordinate part--The Parisian book-binding Code--The difference between the French and ourselves--The original publisher's boards--The Frenchman's _maroquin rouge_--A suggestion to collectors--Bibliographical _simulacra_--Do not touch!--Sentiment finds a place in England in regard to the treatment of old books--Thoughts which a book may awaken.\n",
      "No such luxurious mode of presenting the type and giving full effect to the work of the illuminator, which so constantly formed a feature and a charm in the productions of the presses of the Continent of Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries has ever since been found possible.\n",
      "It is not the piece of dressed leather with its decorative adjuncts which casts its spell over us: it is the reputation of the courtly patron of learning and art; of the statesman and soldier who sought a diversion in the formation of a library from severer employments; of the prince who loved to gather round him such evidences of his taste, or to lay them at the feet of _a chère amie_; of the licentious but superb Lady Marquise, who vied with her king in the magnificence of her books, as she did with his consort in that of her toilette--it is this which exercises upon our imagination its ridiculous yet unalterable sway.\n",
      "It is not the mere circumstance, let it be understood, of untrimmed edges which makes the charm; many a book or pamphlet occurs as innocent of the binder's knife as the lamb unborn, and highly desirable it is too; but to render an example of this class complete, its authentic outward integument in blameless preservation is as essential to its repute and its marketable worth as the presence of the claws is held to be in the original valuation of a fur of fox or beaver.\n",
      "A French book in old morocco by Derome, Le Gascon, or some other esteemed artist, with its credentials and pedigree above suspicion, may fetch £50 or double; the identical production in old calf or in modern morocco or russia will not bring the price of the binding; all the magic is in the leather and the ticket.\n",
      "Books of Emblems, Catholic Literature, Gardening and Agriculture, Occult Sciences, Early Poetry, Old Plays, Americana, Bewick, Cruikshank, the modern novelists, have all had their day.\n",

      " BOOK-COLLECTOR A General Survey of the Pursuit and of those who have engaged in it at Home and Abroad from the Earliest Period to the Present Time WITH AN ACCOUNT OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIBRARIES AND ANECDOTES OF THEIR FOUNDERS OR OWNERS AND REMARKS ON BOOKBINDING AND ON SPECIAL COPIES OF BOOKS BY W. CAREW HAZLITT JOHN GRANT LONDON 1904 [Illustration: Key to the Characters in the 'Field-day at Sotheby's.']\n",
      "No early English volumes, while I have been on the track, have, if I could help it, escaped my scrutiny; and I have not let them pass from my hands without noting every particular which seemed to me important and interesting in a historical, literary, biographical, and bibliographical respect.\n",
      "A MANUAL for the more immediate and especial use of English-speaking inquirers is bound to limit itself, in the first place, mainly to the literary products of the three kingdoms and the colonies; and, secondly, to a broad and general indication of the various paths which it is open to any one to pursue according to his tastes or possibilities, with clues to the best sources of intelligence and guidance.\n",
      "It was thought, under these circumstances, that a new volume, combining readability and a fair proportion of general interest with practical information and advice, was entitled to favourable consideration; and the peculiar training of the present writer during his whole life, at once as a _litterateur_ and a practical bookman, encouraged the idea on his part that it might well be feasible for him to carry the plan into execution, and produce a view of a permanently interesting and important subject in all its branches and aspects, appealing not only to actual book-collectors, but to those who may naturally desire to learn to what the science and pursuit amount.\n",
      "We must, however, in justice to this branch of the topic and to our readers, refrain from further pursuit of the discussion of it, as its adequate treatment would absorb a monograph to the full extent as ample as the present, and such a Manual is in point of fact a desideratum--one, too, which the improved state of bibliographical knowledge would assist in rendering much more satisfactory than was formerly possible.\n",
      "The book-hunter of times past, if he was a resident in the provinces, and worked on a more or less systematic and ambitious scale--nay, if he merely picked up articles from year to year which struck his fancy, relied, as he was able to do, on his country town.\n",
      "Whatever happens, the stranger coming to hunt in these preserves arrives only in time to learn that the stall or the shop has given up some unique desideratum a day or two before, and is referred to the librarian of the college, or to the buyer at such an address, if he desires to inspect it, which, if his aims are simply commercial, be sure he does not.\n",
      "The country town is as bare as a bird's tail of anything but common-place stuff, bought in the London market, and (if any dweller in a distant city is simple enough to order it from the unsophisticated vendor) charged with a good profit and the freight up.\n",
      "This undoubtedly wide-spread sentiment strikes a very serious blow at a pursuit in which the enthusiast meets with slight sympathy or encouragement, unless it is at the hands of the dealers, naturally bound for their own sakes to keep him in heart by sympathy and flattery.\n",
      "He finds himself, after the lapse of a decade or so, the master of a splendid collection, without having once known what it was to get disagreeably warm or anxious in the pursuit of a volume, to deliberate whether he could afford to buy it, or to submit to the ordeal of attending an auction, one of a motley throng in a fetid atmosphere.\n",
      "Perhaps it would be impossible to name any variety of fancy which has not at some time entered into the pursuit which we are just now attempting to illustrate.\n",
      "This feature in the annals of collecting is the more to be borne in mind, in that it has in recent days declined almost to disappearance, and may be said to be limited to a few gentlewomen, who pursue special studies, like the Hon.\n",
      "The private amateur does well if he keeps before him the salient features connected with his pursuit from this point of view.\n",
      "Leigh Hunt used to speak to me of having attended the great Roxburghe sale in 1812 just for the sake of gaining an idea of what such an affair was.\n",
      "It was said in 1845, when the Bright Library was dispersed, that the advance in realised values led some collectors to relinquish the pursuit.\n",
      "Except as a matter of record and history, the collector need not so greatly concern himself with all those libraries which have been scattered, and yet he finds it desirable to refer to the catalogues, if they were publicly sold, in order to trace books from one hand to another, till they return into the market and find a new owner--perhaps himself.\n",
      "The class of persons who engage in this attractive pursuit are:-- (i) Pure amateurs, without any eye to the financial question.\n",
      "_Liturgies_ form one of the tastes and objects of pursuit of persons who have left behind them the fancies of their novitiate, and possess the means of purchasing a description of literature which is abnormally costly, and might prove more so, were the buyers more numerous.\n",
      "For instance, Dyce, who laid a collateral stress on _Shakespeariana_; Ireland, who made himself strong in Leigh Hunt and Hazlitt; Crossley, who had a peculiar affection for Defoe; Bliss, who collected books of characters and books printed at Oxford or just before the Great Fire of 1666; Bandinel, who was smitten by the charms of the Civil War literature; Corser, whose bibliographical sweethearts were Nicholas Breton and Richard Brathwaite; and Rimbault, who had two, Old Music and Old Plays.\n",
      "On the contrary, there are for our consideration and instruction the libraries which owed their existence to less interesting motives, to the vague and untrained pursuit of rare and expensive books and MSS., on the judgment of others in rivalry of others, and the enterers into the field of competition with a practical eye and a financial side-look.\n",
      "The late Earl of Ashburnham bought in chief measure during the forties and fifties, when the reaction from the bibliomania still more or less sensibly prevailed, and considering his Lordship's position and resources, he was not much more lavish than the above-mentioned Mr. Pyne, or indeed any other amateur of average calibre, while he was to the full extent as genuine a follower of the pursuit for its mere sake as anybody whom we could name--as the Duke of Roxburghe, Mr. Heber, Mr. Corser, or Mr. Crossley.\n",
      "In my _Rolls of Collectors_ I specify a type under the designation of _Book-Recipients_, and I instance such cases as Dickens and Thackeray; but in fact there are many who would never go in pursuit of anything of the kind beyond a work of reference, and whose utmost exploit is the payment of a friendly subscription.\n",
      "But both these works long remained--the Bacon yet does so--outside the collector's pale and cognisance, and the real cause was that they were alike common; they had been the favourites of successive generations; edition upon edition had been demanded; and the survival of copies was too great to suit the book-hunter, who aims at shyer quarry.\n",
      "They are no catch-pennies.\n",
      "Hunter's _New Illustrations of Shakespeare_.\n",
      "Hunter's _Historical Tracts_.\n",
      "Hunter's _Account of New Plymouth_, 2nd edition.\n",
      "# See that passage where the opinion of James, Earl of Balcarres, is quoted in regard to the duty of men to leave behind them some trace or record of their mind.\n",
      "There is something so taking in the notion of a tattered, semi-illegible, unappropriated fractional relic, not a trunk even; it fascinates us like a coin of which the legend is almost beyond identification; there is mystery behind it; we may be on the track of a discovery which will help to make us famous.\n",
      "Whatever may be the cause, we have hitherto failed to trace duplicates of the metrical _Ship of Fools_, 1509, _Queen Elizabeth's Prayer-Book_, 1569, Watson's _Teares of Fancie_, 1593, _Venus and Adonis_, 1593, 1599, and 1617, and of _Lucrece_, 1598.\n",
      "If we remember that certain of the Bibles ordered to be kept in churches for general use chiefly survive in crumbling fragments, or at best woefully dilapidated copies, we cease to be surprised at the easy prey which more fugitive compositions have formed to a succession of careless and indifferent owners.\n",
      "And this interesting commercial strategy is always going on, while the objects of pursuit continually vary.\n"

      "It is by no means that we seek to ridicule or discourage the pursuit, but we want and wish to see a more healthy and discriminating spirit among buyers.\n",
      "The mission of the modern recensor comes to an end when, by a stupendous amount of research and erudition, he has emphasised the characteristics and gifts of a writer.\n",
      "But there are two other series of very unequal extent, importance, and costliness, which more directly appeal to the buyers of these islands, namely, the earlier Anglo-American literature belonging to the Colonial period, and the American reproductions of the favourite books of Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, Thackeray, and others in the present century.\n",
      "Bohn's _Lowndes_ yields a fair account of this family of literature; and Alexander Ireland, Richard Herne Shepherd, and others have bestowed vast pains on drawing up monographs on Coleridge, Hazlitt, Hunt, Shelley, Lamb, Keats, Browning, Tennyson, and the rest.\n",
      "It is difficult to foresee what the final upshot may be; probably, when fabulous prices have drawn forth from their hiding-places additional copies of many of these latter-day objects of keen pursuit, the market will fall and the craze will subside.\n",
      "Book-collecting seems scarcely to concern very closely those who regard the pursuit from a severely practical point of view, or in the aspect of absolute intrinsic importance.\n",
      "Apart from the collector, the first and the best impressions of writers of importance, whose texts underwent at their own hands more or less material changes, are necessarily an object of research to the editor or specialist who has dedicated his attention to such or such a study; and he is apt to pursue the matter still further than the amateur, who does not, as a rule, esteem the intermediate issues.\n",
      "It is this feeling and need which have led, since critical and comparative editions came into fashion, to the accumulation by their superintendents of an exhaustive array of titles and dates, with hints of the most remarkable various readings; and the cause of bibliography has gained, whether, in drawing together the series, the book-hunter or the literary worker be the pioneer.\n",
      "Our collectors, however, are not particularly solicitous to study the present aspect of the matter, and the hunter for First Editions is by no means likely to care an iota about the purity of the text, but may be more apt to congratulate himself on the ownership of the genuine old copy with all the errors of the press as vouchers for its character.\n",
      "Looking at the illustrated editions of the _Tales_ generally, the plates, except the charming head and tail pieces, do great injustice to the text, which the author can hardly have foreseen the possibility of being deformed and discredited by such forced and exaggerated constructions of his meaning.\n",
      "The cultivation of the pursuit has naturally brought into existence a small library of monographs, of which that by Cohen is one of the best known and the most frequently quoted.\n",
      "His taste has happened to take a bibliographical direction and shape; it is hardly a literary one; and the objects of his pursuit, instead of being pictures, prints, antiquities, gems, or coins, are things in book-form.\n",
      "If he, or any one else, made gifts of such things to the greatest of them all, every trace of such an incident has apparently disappeared.\n",
      "Yet the feeling for the printed matter between the two covers or behind the paper label was more genuine, may be, and more practical when a handful of volumes, reflecting the personal predilections or requirements of the owner, gradually accumulated, and the acquisition did not amount to a pursuit, much less to a passion and a competitive race.\n",
      "What noble sets of books, as well as single volumes, have almost crumbled away in damp country-houses, sometimes relegated to the garret or the stable by the intelligent and highly-educated proprietors, while others have fallen a prey to gas and dust in town.\n",
      "Artistic and historical book-covers have more than a special and technical importance, inasmuch as they contribute to enrich a pursuit which might otherwise become more limited in its interest than it is.\n",
      "Many are the traditional anecdotes of the wonderful bargains which Longmans' agent secured for his principals in all sorts of places, whither he resorted in quest of prey--of the romances in folio in the virgin stamped Spanish bindings, which they might have worn since they lay on the shelves of Don Quixote or the Licentiate, brought for sale, as it were haphazard, to some market-place in Seville or Valladolid in wine-skins.\n",
      "He was a very rich man; but he was not a book-hunter, and he was both inconsistent and capricious.\n",
      "The book-hunter's motto is _Pulchra quæ difficilia_; he reverses the common saying.\n",
      "It affords a pleasanter impression of the pursuit when one perceives individuals of all ranks and callings buying themselves personally, either at the book-shop or the saleroom, in the selection of their periodical acquisitions.\n",
      "The most eminent of the earlier race of auctioneers in London, who confined their attention to properties belonging to the fine arts, were William Cooper, a man of considerable literary taste and culture, whom we have seen disposing of Dr.\n",
      "What must strike any one who has attentively considered the Heber library, even if it is not a case of having had the catalogue at his elbow, as I have, in a manner, all his life, is the presence there of so large a number of items of which no trace occurs in earlier lists, and of which no duplicates have since presented themselves.\n",
      "Where the goods on sale are of a prevailingly low standard, the scene varies in compliance with the circumstances, and the purchasers' names in the priced catalogue are almost without exception the names of booksellers, who make their account by going in for heavy lots and rough stuff--an excellent vocation thirty years ago, but now a fairly forlorn hope and quest.\n",
      "Nevertheless it exists, and will continue from the nature of things to do so; and we observe in the very opening decade of auctions, in the very infancy of the system, a trace or germ of this commencing impurity or abuse.\n",

      "Bibliomania has as many heads as the famed Briareus; but it seldom lifts more than two or three at once.\n",
      "It is said of the elder Wertheimer that, when some one expressed his astonishment at the price which he had given for an item, and even insinuated his want of wisdom, he retorted pleasantly that he might be a fool, but he thought that he knew greater ones than himself.\n",
      "The late Earl of Ashburnham bought in chief measure during the forties and fifties, when the reaction from the bibliomania still more or less sensibly prevailed, and considering his Lordship's position and resources, he was not much more lavish than the above-mentioned Mr. Pyne, or indeed any other amateur of average calibre, while he was to the full extent as genuine a follower of the pursuit for its mere sake as anybody whom we could name--as the Duke of Roxburghe, Mr. Heber, Mr. Corser, or Mr. Crossley.\n",

      "The hard-fighting Junot had a vellum library which sold in London for 1,400 pounds, while his great master was not too busy in conquering Europe not only to solace himself in his permanent libraries, and in books which he carried with him in his expeditions, but to project and actually commence the printing of a camp library of duodecimo volumes, without margins, and in thin covers, to embrace some three thousand volumes, and which he had designed to complete in six years by employing one hundred and twenty compositors and twenty-five editors, at an outlay of about 163,000 pounds.\n",
      "And yet a great degree of slovenliness may be excused in Charles because, according to Leigh Hunt, he once gave a kiss to an old folio Chapman's \"Homer,\" and when asked how he knew his books one from the other, for hardly any were lettered, he answered: \"How does a shepherd know his sheep?\"\n",
      "The love of books displayed by the sensual Henry and the pugnacious Junot is not more remarkable than that of the epicurean and sumptuous Lucullus, to whom Pompey, when sick, having been directed by his physician to eat a thrush for dinner, and learning from his servants that in summer-time thrushes were not to be found anywhere but in Lucullus' fattening coops, refused to be indebted for his meal, observing: \"So if Lucullus had not been an epicure, Pompey had not lived.\"\n",
      "He did not love the country, and the only thing that could tempt him thither was a book.\n",
      "Acknowledging this to Phædrus he says: \"Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse me when you hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge, and the men who dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees or the country.\n",
      "Thus there are bibliomaniacs who reprint rare books from their own libraries in limited numbers; authors, like Walpole, who print their own works, and whose fame as printers is better deserved than their reputation as writers; like Thackeray, who design the illustrations for their own romances, or, like Astor, who procure a single copy of their novel to be illustrated at lavish expense by artists; amateurs who bind their own books; lunatics who yearn for books wholly engraved, or printed only on one side of the leaf, or Greek books wholly in capitals, or others in the italic letter; or black-letter fanciers; or tall copy men; or rubricists, missal men, or first edition men, or incunabulists.\n",
      "My Walton should his gentle art In Salmon best express, And Penn and Fox the friendly heart In quiet drab confess.\n",
      "The best of them I know by heart, As for the rest they make me tired; The viler part May well be fired.\n",
      "The heart will wander, never doubt, Though waking faith it keep; That is exceptionally stout Which strays but in its sleep; And hearts must always turn to her Who loved, \"Les Egaremens du Coeur.\"\n",
      "These beloved objects ought to deny themselves a ring, or a horse, or a gown, or a ball now and then, to atone for their mankind's debauchery in books; but do they?\n",
      "In the charming romance, \"Realmah,\" the noble African prince prescribes monogamy to his subjects, but he allows himself three wives; one is a State wife, to sit by his side on the throne, help him receive embassadors, and preside at court dinners; another a household wife, to rule the kitchen and the homely affairs of the palace; the third is a love-wife, to be cherished in his heart and bear him children.\n",
      "The worst of these is when he extends the text of the volume itself to a larger page in order to embrace large prints.\n",
      "But I am more an adherent of the romantic school, which finds excellent play in the illustration of poetry.\n",
      "For \"The Croakers\" there are apt illustrations also of the following queer subjects: Korah, Dathan and Abiram; Miss Atropos, shut up your Scissors; Albany's two Steeples high in Air, Reading Cobbett's Register, Bony in His Prison Isle, Giant Wife, Beauty and The Beast, Fly Market, Tammany Hall, The Dove from Noah's Ark, Rome Saved by Geese, Cæsar Offered a Crown, Cæsar Crossing the Rubicon, Dick Ricker's Bust, Sancho in His Island Reigning, The Wisest of Wild Fowl, Reynold' Beer House, A Mummy, A Chimney Sweep, The Arab's Wind, Pygmalion, Danae, Highland Chieftain with His Tail On, Nightmare, Shaking Quakers, Polony's Crazy Daughter, Bubble-Blowing, First Pair of Breeches, Banquo's Ghost, Press Gang, Fair Lady With the Bandaged Eye, A Warrior Leaning on His Sword, A Warrior's Tomb, A Duel, and A Street Flirtation.\n",
      "A man is not apt to marry the woman who flings herself at his head; he loves the excitement of courting; and so there is not much amusement in utilizing common pictures, but the charm consists in hunting for scarce ones.\n",
      "An illustrated Shakespeare in thirty volumes is theoretically a very grand object, but I should never have the heart to open it, and as for histories, I should as soon think of illustrating a dictionary.\n",
      "For example, I know one, stigmatized as eccentric, who has illustrated a printed catalogue of his own library with portraits of the authors, copies of prints in the books, and duplicates of engraved title-pages; also one who has illustrated a collection in print or in manuscript of his own poems; also one who has illustrated a Life of Hercules, written by himself, printed by one of his own family, and adorned with prints from antique gems and other subjects; and even a lawyer who has illustrated a law book written by himself, in which he has found place for prints so diverse and apparently out of keeping as Jonah and the whale, John Brown, a man pacing the floor in a nightgown with a crying baby, a \"darkey\" shot in a melon-patch, an elephant on the rampage, Cupid, Hudibras writing a letter, Joanna Southcote, Launce and his dog, a dog catching a boy going over a wall, Dr. Watts, Robinson Crusoe, Barnum in the form of a hum-bug, Jacob Hall the rope dancer, Lord Mayor's procession, Raphael discoursing to Adam, gathering sea-weed, Artemus Ward, a whale ashore, a barber-shop, Gilpin's ride, King Lear, St. Lawrence on his gridiron, Charles Lamb, Terpsichore, and a child tumbling into a well.\n",
      "Hence the reluctance of the Illustrator to commit himself to binding, a reluctance only paralleled by that of the lover to marry the woman he had courted for ten years, because then he would have no place to spend his evenings.\n",
      "So one will find it difficult to get \"God's scales,\" in which wealth and poverty are weighed against each other, but I have had other scales thrust at me, such as those in which the emblems of love are weighed against those of religion, and a king against a beggar, but even the latter is not the precise thing, for in these days there are poor kings and rich beggars.\n",
      "One can hardly expect that his family will care for these things; the son generally thinks the Book-Worm a bore, and the wife of one's bosom and the daughter of one's heart usually affect more interest than they feel, and if they kept such objects would do so from a sense of duty alone, as the ancient Romans preserved the cinerary urns of their ancestors.\n"

      "I remember some of my booksellers with positive affection.\n",
      "While walking that night with the bibliophile, On the Quai Malaquais by the Rue de Saints Peres, The Emperor saw, with satirical smile, Enkindling his stove, in the chill evening air, With leaves which he tore from a tome by his side, A bookseller ancient, with tremulous hands; And laying aside his imperial pride, \"What book are you burning?\"\n",
      "His books extend on every side, And up and down the vistas wide His eye can take them in; He does not love these books at all, Their usefulness in big and small He counts as but a sin.\n",
      "I love their figures quaint and queer, Which on the inviting page appear, From those of good Dame Juliana, Who lifts a fish and cries hosanna, To those of Stothard, graceful Quaker, Of fishy art supremest maker, Whose fisherman, so dry and neat, Would never soil a parlor seat.\n",
      "I love them all, the books on angling, And far from cares and business jangling, Ensconced in cosy chimney-corner, Like the traditional Jack Horner, I read from Walton down to Lang, And hum that song the Milkmaid sang.\n",
      "To constitute a bibliomaniac in the true sense, the love of books must combine with a certain limitation of means for the gratification of the appetite.\n",
      "We read in Dibdin's sumptuous pages of the celebrated contest between the Duke of Devonshire and the Marquis of Blandford for the possession of the Valdarfar Decameron; we read with admiration, but we also read of the immortal battle of Elia with the little squab-keeper of the old book-stall in Ninety-four alley, over the ownership of a ragged duodecimo for a sixpence; we read with affection.\n",
      "To haunt the book-stores, there to see a long-desired work in luxurious and tempting style, reluctantly to abandon it for the present on account of the price; to go home and dream about it, to wonder, for a year, and perchance longer, whether it will ever again greet your eyes; to conjecture what act of desperation you might in heat of passion commit toward some more affluent man in whose possession you should thereafter find it; to see it turn up again in another book-shop, its charms slightly faded, but yet mellowed by age, like those of your first love, met in later life--with this difference, however, that whereas you crave those of the book more than ever, you are generally quite satisfied with yourself for not having, through the greenness of youth, yielded untimely to those of the lady; to ask with assumed indifference the price, and learn with ill-dissembled joy that it is now within your means; to say you'll take it; to place it beneath your arm, and pay for it (or more generally order it \"charged\"); to go forth from that room with feelings akin to those of Ulysses when he brought away the Palladium from Troy; to keep a watchful eye on the parcel in the railway coach on your way home, or to gloat over the treasures of its pages, and wonder if the other passengers have any suspicion of your good fortune; and finally to place the volume on your shelf, and thenceforth to call it your own--this is indeed a pleasure denied to the affluent, so keen as to be akin to pain, and only marred by the palling which always follows possession and the presentation of your book-seller's account three months afterwards.\n",
      "When I puff my cigarette, Straight I see a Spanish girl, Mantilla, fan, coquettish curl, Languid airs and dimpled face, Calculating fatal grace; Hear a twittering serenade Under lofty balcony played; Queen at bull-fight, naught she cares What her agile lover dares; She can love and quick forget.\n",
      "Let me but my meerschaum light, I behold a bearded man, Built upon capacious plan, Sabre-slashed in war or duel, Gruff of aspect but not cruel, Metaphysically muddled, With strong beer a little fuddled, Slow in love and deep in books, More sentimental than he looks, Swears new friendships every night.\n",
      "Fickle fortune, stubborn fate, Right discovered all too late, Beings loved and gone before, Beings loved but friends no more, Self-reproach and futile sighs, Vanity in birth that dies, Longing, heart-break, adoration,-- Nothing sure in expectation Save ash-receiver at the last.\n",
      "With traitorous kiss remarked my spouse, \"Remain down town to lunch to-day, For we are busy cleaning house, And you would be in Minnie's way.\"\n",
      "Rolled up till head and tail are one; Usurping all the softest places And keeping them with doggish graces; To sneak between the housemaid's feet And scour unnoticed on the street; Wag indefatigable tail; Cajole with piteous human wail; To dance with dainty dandy air When nicely parted is his hair, And look most ancient and dejected When it has been too long neglected; To sleep upon my book-den rug And dream of battle with a pug; To growl with counterfeited rabies; To be more trouble than twin babies;-- These are the qualities and tricks That in my heart his image fix; And so in cursory, doggerel rhyme I celebrate him in his time, Nor wait his virtues to rehearse In cold obituary verse.\n",
      "Another clock is rococo, Of Louis Sept or Seize, With many a dreadful furbelow An artist's hair to raise, Suggestions of a giddy court, With fan and boufflant bustle, When silken trains made gallant sport And o'er the floor did rustle.\n",
      "Those hazel eyes pursue me as I move And seem to watch my busy toiling pen; They hold me with an anxious yearning love, As if she dwelt upon the earth again.\n",
      "The snows have settled on my head But not upon my heart, And incidents of years long fled From out my memory start.\n",
      "But still my mind will backward turn For half a century, And without reasoning will yearn For sight or news of thee, Thou playmate of my boyhood days, When life was all aglow, When the sweetest thing was thy girlish praise, As I drew thee o'er the snow To the old red school-house by the road, Where we learned to spell and read, When thou wert all my fairy load And I was thy prancing steed.\n",
      "Artless and unconstrained, With quaintly knotted auburn hair From which the wind refrained, And from thine earnest steady eyes Shone out a nature pure, Formed by kind Heaven, a man's best prize, To love and to endure.\n",
      "And didst thou marry, or art thou Still of the spinster tribe?\n",
      "When at court on the great judgment day With penitent suitors I mingle, May my guilt be washed cleanly away, Like that on my faded old shingle!\n",
      "I love the quaint form of the sceptered king, The simplicity of the ace, The stolid knave like a wooden thing, And her majesty's smirking face.\n",
      "Even the kings and heroes who have lived in history live more vividly for us in romance.\n",
      "There is no character in romance who has not or might not have lived, but we are thrown into grave doubts of the saintly Washington and the devilish Napoleon depicted three quarters of a century ago.\n",
      "We cast history aside in scepticism and disgust; we cling to romance with faith and delight.\n",
      "Saint-Simon and Grammont rehearse Their tales of court with glee; For all their scandal I'm no worse,-- They never peach on me.\n",

      "The Track of the Book-Worm.\n",
      "One of the wisest of the human race said, the only earthly immortality is in writing a book; and the desire to accumulate these evidences of earthly immortality needs no defense among cultivated men.\n",
      "But the great Thomas was recklessly careless and slovenly in his use of books; and Burton, in the \"Book-hunter,\" tells us that \"he once gave in copy written on the edges of a tall octavo 'Somnium Scipionis,' and as he did not obliterate the original matter, the printer was rather puzzled, and made a funny jumble between the letter-press Latin and the manuscript English.\"\n",
      "I seriously fear that with him must be ranked the gentle Elia, who said: \"A book reads the better which is our own, and has been so long known to us that we know the topography of its blots and dog's ears, and can trace the dirt in it to having read it at tea with buttered muffins, or over a pipe, which I think is the maximum.\"\n",
      "And yet a great degree of slovenliness may be excused in Charles because, according to Leigh Hunt, he once gave a kiss to an old folio Chapman's \"Homer,\" and when asked how he knew his books one from the other, for hardly any were lettered, he answered: \"How does a shepherd know his sheep?\"\n",
      "The tricks of the book-trade to catch the inexperienced with the bait of large paper are very amusing.\n",
      "The prize-ring record of the past Must be in blue and black; While any color that is fast Would do for Derby track.\n",
      "Charles Cowden-Clarke tells of his having ordered Leigh Hunt's poems entitled \"Foliage\" to be bound in green, and how the book came home in blue.\n",
      "The good that authors thus may reap I'll not pursue to tedium, But hint, for books on raising sheep Buckram is just the medium.\n",
      "M. Uzanne, in \"The Book-Hunter in Paris,\" avers that \"the woman of fashion never goes book-hunting,\" and he puts the aphorism in italics.\n",
      "After the reading there was a moment's silence, and then one observed that she would like to know whether they took that ride on horseback or in a \"buggy.\"\n",
      "Another silence, and then an artless young bud ventured the remark that she thought it must have been in a buggy, because if it was on horseback he could not have got his arm around her.\n",
      "John Hill Burton set the tune by his merry satire in \"The Book-Hunter,\" in which he portrays the Grangerite illustrating the pious Watts' stanzas, beginning, \"How doth the little busy bee.\"\n",
      "Such agency is frequently very unsatisfactory, and at all events the Illustrator misses the sport of the hunt.\n",
      "And now let me make a few suggestions as to what seems to me the most suitable mode of the pursuit.\n",
      "For example, if Charles V. and Titian are mentioned together, it would be interesting to insert a picture representing the historical incident of the emperor picking up and handing the artist a brush which he had dropped--and one will have an interesting hunt to find it.\n",
      "\"And like a tom-cat dies by inches,\" is illustrated by a picture of a cat caught by the paw in a steel trap.\n",
      "For \"The Croakers\" there are apt illustrations also of the following queer subjects: Korah, Dathan and Abiram; Miss Atropos, shut up your Scissors; Albany's two Steeples high in Air, Reading Cobbett's Register, Bony in His Prison Isle, Giant Wife, Beauty and The Beast, Fly Market, Tammany Hall, The Dove from Noah's Ark, Rome Saved by Geese, Cæsar Offered a Crown, Cæsar Crossing the Rubicon, Dick Ricker's Bust, Sancho in His Island Reigning, The Wisest of Wild Fowl, Reynold' Beer House, A Mummy, A Chimney Sweep, The Arab's Wind, Pygmalion, Danae, Highland Chieftain with His Tail On, Nightmare, Shaking Quakers, Polony's Crazy Daughter, Bubble-Blowing, First Pair of Breeches, Banquo's Ghost, Press Gang, Fair Lady With the Bandaged Eye, A Warrior Leaning on His Sword, A Warrior's Tomb, A Duel, and A Street Flirtation.\n",
      "As the charm of illustrating consists in the hunt for the prints, so the latter method is the more engrossing because the game is the more difficult to run down.\n",
      "For example, it was a weary chase to get a treadmill, and so of a drum-major, although the latter is now not uncommon: and although I know it exists, I have not attained unto a bastinado.\n",
      "I'm almost wild To find a wood-cut of his hatchet.\n",
      "For example, I know one, stigmatized as eccentric, who has illustrated a printed catalogue of his own library with portraits of the authors, copies of prints in the books, and duplicates of engraved title-pages; also one who has illustrated a collection in print or in manuscript of his own poems; also one who has illustrated a Life of Hercules, written by himself, printed by one of his own family, and adorned with prints from antique gems and other subjects; and even a lawyer who has illustrated a law book written by himself, in which he has found place for prints so diverse and apparently out of keeping as Jonah and the whale, John Brown, a man pacing the floor in a nightgown with a crying baby, a \"darkey\" shot in a melon-patch, an elephant on the rampage, Cupid, Hudibras writing a letter, Joanna Southcote, Launce and his dog, a dog catching a boy going over a wall, Dr. Watts, Robinson Crusoe, Barnum in the form of a hum-bug, Jacob Hall the rope dancer, Lord Mayor's procession, Raphael discoursing to Adam, gathering sea-weed, Artemus Ward, a whale ashore, a barber-shop, Gilpin's ride, King Lear, St. Lawrence on his gridiron, Charles Lamb, Terpsichore, and a child tumbling into a well.\n",
      "There are three singular things about the hunt for pictures.\n",
      "They are frequently the only means of illustrating a subject, and small and fine wood-cuts form charming head and tail pieces and marginal adornments.\n",
      "It cannot be denied that it is a fascinating pursuit.\n",
      "I have referred to Mr. Lang's antipathy to book-plate collectors, and while, as I have observed, he goes to extravagant lengths in condemning their pursuit, still it may be of interest to my readers to know just what he says about them, and so I reproduce below a ballad on the subject, with (the material for) which he kindly supplied me when I solicited his mild expression of opinion on the subject: THE SNATCHERS.\n",
      "When there is something especially desirable going, I frequently fail to catch his eye, and my rival gets the prize.\n",
      "Monsieur Uzanne, who has treated of the elegancies of the Fan, the Muff, and the Umbrella, has more recently given the world a quite unique series of studies among the bookstalls and the quays of Paris--\"The Book Hunter in Paris\"--and this too one finds more entertaining than any account of Quaritch's or Putnam's shop would be.\n",
      "One of these wrappings I have preserved, exhibiting a pen-and-ink drawing of a war-ship firing a big gun at a few small birds.\n",
      "When the pioneer on the western plains purchases an expensive rifle he does not inquire whether he can sell it for what it costs; his purpose is to defend his house against Indians and other wild beasts.\n",
      "The determination not to be outdone does not lend dignity or worth to the pursuit which would otherwise be commendable.\n",
      "One of course does not expect another to relinquish to him his place in a \"queue\" at a box-office or his turn at a barber's shop, but in the noble and elegant pursuit of book-collecting it would be well to emulate the politeness of the French at Fontenoy, and hat in hand offer our antagonist the first shot.\n",
      "No longer does the Book-Worm sit in his modest book-room, absorbed in his adored volumes, heedless of the waning lamp and the setting star, of hunger and thirst, unmindful of the scent of the clover wafted in at the window, deaf to the hum of the bees and the low of the kine, blind to the glow of sunsets and the soft contour of the blue hills, and the billowy swaying of the wheat field before the gentle breath of the south.\n",
      "Why should I jolt upon a horse And after wretched vermin roam, When I can choose an easier course With Fox and Hare and Hunt at home?\n",
      "The modern Book-Worm deals in sums of six figures; he keeps an agent \"on the other side;\" he cables his demands and his decisions; his name flutters the dovecotes in the auction-room; to him is proffered the first chance at a rarity worth a King's ransom; too busy to potter in person with such a trifle as the purchase of a Mazarine Bible, he hires others to do the hunting and he merely receives the game; the tiger skin and the elephant's tusk are laid at his feet to order, but he misses all the joy and ardor of the hunt.\n",
      "Tis sweet to sit in shady nook, Or wade in rapid crystal brook, Impervious in rubber boots, And wary of the slippery roots, To snare the swift evasive trout Or eke the sauntering horn-pout; Or in the cold Canadian river To see the glorious salmon quiver, And them with tempting hook inveigle, Fit viand for a table regal; Or after an exciting bout To snatch the pike with sharpened snout; Or with some patient ass to row To troll for bass with motion slow.\n",
      "I get not tired nor wet nor cross, Nor suffer monetary loss-- If fish are shy and will not bite, And shun the snare laid in their sight-- In order home at night to bring A fraudulent, deceitful string, And thus escape the merry jeers Of heartless piscatory peers; Nor have to listen to the lying Of fishermen while fish are frying, Who boast of draughts miraculous Which prove too large a draught on us.\n",
      "He who only has to draw his check to obtain his desire fails to reach the keenest bliss of the pursuit.\n",
      "There is the same difference of sensation between the acquirement of books by a wealthy man and by him of slender purse, that there is between the taking of fish in a net and the successful result of a long angling pursuit after one especially fat and evasive trout.\n",
      "So we read Leigh Hunt's confession that when he \"cut open a new catalogue of old books, and put crosses against dozens of volumes in the list, out of the pure imagination of buying them, the possibility being out of the question.\"\n",
      "But on looking about him, he could not determine which child to take, and so observing to his wife, \"All or none,\" he set her and the baby on the horse, and brought up the rear on foot with his gun, and fended off the redskins and brought the whole family into safety.\n",
      "So many books I can't endure-- The dull and commonplace, The dirty, trifling and obscure, The realistic race.\n",
      "As a rule I do not care for any constant human companion in my library, but I do not object to a cat or a small dog.\n",
      "In my library hangs Durer's picture of St. Jerome in his cell, busy with his writing, and a dog and a lion quietly dozing together in the foreground.\n",
      "As I am no saint I have never been able to keep a lion in my library for any great length of time, but I have maintained a dog there.\n",
      "Lamb even contended that his books were the better for being dog's-eared, but I do not go so far as that.\n",
      "Here is a portrait of MY DOG.\n",
      "Rolled up till head and tail are one; Usurping all the softest places And keeping them with doggish graces; To sneak between the housemaid's feet And scour unnoticed on the street; Wag indefatigable tail; Cajole with piteous human wail; To dance with dainty dandy air When nicely parted is his hair, And look most ancient and dejected When it has been too long neglected; To sleep upon my book-den rug And dream of battle with a pug; To growl with counterfeited rabies; To be more trouble than twin babies;-- These are the qualities and tricks That in my heart his image fix; And so in cursory, doggerel rhyme I celebrate him in his time, Nor wait his virtues to rehearse In cold obituary verse.\n",
      "Those hazel eyes pursue me as I move And seem to watch my busy toiling pen; They hold me with an anxious yearning love, As if she dwelt upon the earth again.\n",
      "Do grandsons round thy hearthstone play, Or dost thou end thy race?\n"

      "Many years ago when Burton, the great comedian, was in his prime, he used to act in a farce called \"Toodles\"--at all events, that was his name in the play--and he was afflicted with a wife who had a mania for attending auctions and buying all kinds of things, useful or useless, provided that they only seemed cheap.\n",
      "He pastes them in a big, blank book To show them to some rival fool, And I pronounce him, when I look, An almost idiotic ghoul.\n",
      "But the greater part this does not grieve a true Book-Worm, for he would scorn ownership of a vast majority of the books which he shows, but on the comparatively rare occasions when he is called on to produce a real book (in the sense of Bibliomania), he must be saddened by the reflection that it is not his own, and that the inspection of it is demanded of him as a matter of right.\n",
      "It was this characteristic which led me in my youth, before I had been inducted into the delights of Bibliomania and had learned to appreciate the feelings of a librarian, to define him as one who conceives it to be his duty to prevent the public from seeing the books.\n",

      "Once, rambling in the narrow alleys about the ancient church, our book-hunter ventured through a gothic doorway along a broad passage that was guarded by a huge and ancient iron grille and presently he found himself in a small courtyard paved with moss-grown cobbles.\n",
      "Above the gallery and across the front of the building had been painted the legend HOTEL DU LION D'OR, and a dim weatherbeaten shield above the doorway still bore the trace of a rampant lion.\n",

      "The monotonous habits of a cloistered bibliophile will, perhaps, appear dry and fastidious, but still it is curious and interesting to observe how carefully the monks regarded their vellum tomes, how indefatigably they worked to increase their stores, and how eagerly they sought for books.\n",
      "As a bibliophile it is somewhat pleasing to trace a deep book passion growing up in the barrenness of the cloister, and to find in some cowled monk a bibliomaniac as warm and enthusiastic in his way as the renowned \"Atticus,\" or the noble Roxburghe, of more recent times.\n",
      "If we dwell on these scraps of information, we shall discover some marks of a love of learning among them, and the liberality they displayed in lending their books to each other is a pleasing trait to dwell upon.\n",
      "For a missal the monk was to make a similar movement with a sign of the cross; for the gospels the sign of the cross on the forehead; for an antiphon or book of responses he was to strike the thumb and little finger of the other hand together; for a book of offices or gradale to make the sign of a cross and kiss the fingers; for a tract lay the hand on the abdomen and apply the other hand to the mouth; for a capitulary make the general sign and extend the clasped hands to heaven; for a psalter place the hands upon the head in the form of a crown, such as the king is wont to wear.\n",
      "As for myself, it would be difficult to convince me, with all those fine relics of their deeds before me, those beauteous fanes dedicated to piety and God, those libraries so crowded with their vellum tomes, so gorgeously adorned, and the abundant evidence which history bears to their known charity and hospitable love, that these monks and their system was a scheme of dismal barbarism; it may be so, but my reading has taught me different; but, on the other hand, although the monks possessed many excellent qualities, being the encouragers of literature, the preservers of books, and promulgators of civilization, we must not hide their numerous and palpable faults, or overlook the poison which their system of monachism _ultimately_ infused into the very vitals of society.\n",
      "But there were many cloistered Christians who studied the bible undisturbed by these shadows and doubts, and who, heedless of patristical lore and saintly wisdom, devoured the spiritual food in its pure and uncontaminating simplicity--such students, humble, patient, devoted, will be found crowding the monastic annals, and yielding good evidence of the same by the holy tenor of their sinless lives, their Christian charity and love.\n",

      "The librarii were still further restricted in the economy of their trade, by a rule which forbade any one of them to dispose of his entire stock of books without the consent of the university; but this, I suspect, implied the disposal of the stock and trade together, and was intended to intimate that the introduction of the purchaser would not be allowed, without the cognizance and sanction of the university.\n",

      "Such, however, is beyond the scope of my present design, and I have only to turn over those ancient chronicles to find how the love of books flourished in monkish days; so that, whilst I may here and there pass unnoticed some ingenious author, or only casually remark upon his talents, all that relate to libraries or book-collecting, to bibliophiles or scribes, I shall carefully record; and, I think, from the notes now lying before me, and which I am about to arrange in something like order, the reader will form a very different idea of monkish libraries than he previously entertained.\n",

      "Often, indeed, will the student close the volumes of those old monastic writers with a sad, depressed, and almost broken heart; so often will he find men who seem capable of better things, who here and there breathe forth all the warm aspirations of a devout and Christian heart, bowed down and grovelling in the dust, as it were, to prove their blind submission to the Pope, thinking, poor fellows!--for from my very heart I pity them--that by so doing they were preaching that humility so acceptable to the Lord.\n",
      "Cheering then, to the heart it is to find this monotony broken by such an instance, and although we find Ælfric occasionally diverging into the paths of papistical error, he spreads a ray of light over the gloom of those Saxon days, and offers pleasing evidence that Christ never forsook his church; that even amidst the peril and darkness of those monkish ages there were some who mourned, though it might have been in a monastery, submissive to a Roman Pontiff, the depravity and corruption with which the heart of man had marred it.\n",
      "With many of the doctrines advocated therein, the protestant will not agree; but the bibliophile will admit that he gave an indication of his love of books by the 21st Canon, which directs that, \"Before a priest can be ordained, he must be armed with the sacred books, for the spiritual battle, namely, a Psalter, Book of Epistles, Book of Gospels, the Missal Book, Books of Hymns, the Manual, or Euchiridion, the Gerim, the Passional, the Pænitential, and the Lectionary, or Reading Book; these the diligent priest requires, and let him be careful that they are all accurately written, and free from faults.\n",

      "When William Carelepho, a Norman monk, was consecrated bishop, the church had so increased in wealth and usefulness, that fresh wants arose, more space was requisite, and a grander structure would be preferable; the bishop thereupon pulled the old church of Aldwine down and commenced the erection of a more magnificent one in its place, as the beauty of Durham cathedral sufficiently testifies even now; and will not the lover of artistic beauty award his praise to the Norman bishop--those massive columns and stupendous arches excite the admiring wonder of all; built on a rocky eminence and surrounded by all the charms of a romantic scenery, it is one of the finest specimens of architecture which the enthusiasm of monkish days dedicated to piety and to God.\n",

      "De Bury, whilst negociating this affair, visited Antwerp and Brabant for the furtherance of the object of his mission, and he fully embraced this rare opportunity of adding to his literary stores, and returned to his fatherland well laden with many choice and costly manuscripts; for in all his perilous missions he carried about with him, as he tells us, that love of books which many waters could not extinguish, but which greatly sweetened the bitterness of peregrination.\n",
      "Whilst at Paris he was especially assiduous in collecting, and he relates with intense rapture, how many choice libraries he found there full of all kinds of books, which tempted him to spend his money freely; and with a gladsome heart he gave his dirty lucre for treasures so inestimable to the bibliomaniac.\n",
      "The modern bibliophiles who know what it is to revel in the enjoyment of a goodly library, luxuriant in costly bindings and rich in bibliographical rarities, who are fully susceptible to the delights and exquisite sensibilities of that sweet madness called bibliomania, will readily comprehend the multiplied pleasures of that early and illustrious bibliophile in the seclusion of Auckland Palace; he there ardently applied his energies and wealth to the accumulation of books; and whilst engaged in this pleasing avocation, let us endeavor to catch a glimpse of him.\n",

      "How dearly would the bibliomaniac revel over those early annals of his science, could his eye meet those venerable pages--perhaps describing the choice tomes Benedict met with in his Italian tours, and telling us how, and what, and where he gleaned those fine collections; sweet indeed would have been the perusal of that delectable little volume, full of the book experience of a bibliophile in Saxon days, near twelve hundred years ago!\n",
      "[251] Ceolfrid, the successor of Benedict, \"a man of great zeal, of acute wisdom, and bold in action,\" was a great lover of books, and under his care the libraries of Wearmouth and Jarrow became nearly doubled in extent; of the nature of these additions we are unable to judge, but probably they were not contemptible.\n",
      "[252] Wilfrid, bishop of Northumbria, was a dear and intimate friend of Biscop's, and was the companion of one of his pilgrimages to Rome.\n",
      "In his early youth he gave visible signs of a heart full of religion and piety, and he sought by a steady perusal of the Holy Scriptures, in the little monastery of Lindesfarne, to garnish his mind with that divine lore with which he shone so brightly in the Saxon church.\n",
      "It was at the court of Ercenbyrht, king of Kent, that he met with Benedict Biscop; and the sympathy which their mutual learning engendered gave rise to a warm and devoted friendship between them.\n",
      "The revolt of the Frieslanders and the persecution then raging there against the Christians, dissipated his hopes of usefulness; and with a heavy heart, no doubt, Boniface retraced his steps, and re-embarked for his English home.\n",
      "Those elegant epistles reflect the image of their private studies, and so to behold Boniface in a student's garb, to behold his love of books and passion for learning, we must alike have recourse to his letters.\n",
      "The epistolary correspondence of the middle ages is a mirror of those times, far more faithful as regards their social condition than the old chronicles and histories designed for posterity; written in the reciprocity of friendly civilities, they contain the outpourings of the heart, and enable us to peep into the secret thoughts and motives of the writer; \"for out of the fulness of the hearth the mouth speaketh.\"\n",
      "\"[262] All this no doubt the good abbess faithfully fulfilled; and stimulated by his friendship and these encouraging epistles, she set all the pens in her monastery industriously to work, and so gratified the Saxon missionary with those book treasures, which his soul so ardently loved; certain it is, that we frequently find him thanking her for books, and with famishing eagerness craving for more; one of his letters,[263] full of gratitude, he accompanies with a present of a silver graphium, or writing instrument, and soon after we find him thus addressing her: \"To the most beloved sister, Abbess Eadburge, and all now joined to her house and under her spiritual care.\n",
      "\"[274] After the elapse of many years spent in the brilliant court of Charles, during which time it surpassed in literary greatness any epoch that preceded it, he was permitted to seek retirement within the walls of the abbey of St. Martin's at Tours.\n",
      "\"[277] Often did Alcuin think of these goodly times with a longing heart, and wish that he could revel among them whilst in France.\n",
      "If the reader should doubt the ardor of Alcuin as a book-lover, let him read the following letter, addressed to Charlemagne, which none but a bibliomaniac could pen.\n",
      "Many I seek to instruct in the order of the stars which illuminate the glorious vault of heaven; so that they may be made ornaments to the holy church of God and the court of your imperial majesty; that the goodness of God and your kindness may not be altogether unproductive of good.\n",
      "I therefore intreat your Excellence to permit me to send into Britain some of our youths to procure those books which we so much desire, and thus transplant into France the flowers of Britain, that they may fructify and perfume, not only the garden at York, but also the Paradise of Tours; and that we may say, in the words of the song, '_Let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruit_;' and to the young, '_Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink, abundantly, O beloved_;' or exhort, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, '_every one that thirsteth to come to the waters, and ye that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat: yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price_.'\n",
      "[279] In these pleasing labors Alcuin was assisted by many of the most learned men of the time, and especially by Arno, Archbishop of Salzburgh, in writing to whom Alcuin exclaims, \"O that I could suddenly translate my _Abacus_, and with my own hands quickly embrace your fraternity with that warmth which cannot be compressed in books.\n",
      "This Arno, to whom he thus affectionately writes, was no despicable scholar; he was a true lover of literature, and proved himself something of an _amator librorum_, by causing to be transcribed or bought for his use, 150 volumes,[280] but about this period the bookloving mania spread far and wide--the Emperor himself was touched with the enthusiasm; for, besides his choice private collections,[281] he collected together the ponderous writings of the holy fathers, amounting to upwards of 200 volumes, bound in a most sumptuous manner, and commanded them to be deposited in a public temple and arranged in proper order, so that those who could not purchase such treasures might be enabled to feast on the lore of the ancients.\n",
      "But He who sees into the hearts of all--looking in his benevolence more at the intention than the outward form, may perhaps sometimes find in it the workings of a true christian piety, and so reward it with his love.\n",
      "He was a dear lover of books, and spent vast sums in collecting together his private library, amounting to more than 100 volumes; some of these he wrote with his own hand, but most of them he bought _emit_.\n",
      "He probably found much pleasure in perusing his copy of the marvelous tale of \"Beufys of Hampton,\" and the romantic \"Mort d'Arthur,\" both sufficiently interesting to relieve the monotonous vigils of the monastery.\n",
      "Ware._ [246] The youngest son of Oswy, or Oswis, king of Northumbria, who succeeded his father in the year 670, Alfred his elder brother being for a time set aside on the grounds of his illegitimacy; yet Alfred was a far more enlightened and talented prince than Ecgfrid, and much praised in Saxon annals for his love of learning.\n",
      "What a sweet spot for contemplation; surrounded by all that is lovely in nature, it drives our old prejudices away, and touches the heart with piety and awe.\n",
      "Often have I explored its ruins and ascended its crumbling parapets, admiring the taste of those Cistercian monks in choosing so quiet, romantic, and choice a spot, and one so well suited to lead man's thoughts to sacred things above.\n"

      "Four hundred choice volumes comprise this fine collection;[313] and will not the reader be surprised to find among them a selection of the classics, with the chronicles, poetry, and romantic productions of the middle ages, besides an abundant store of the theological writings of the primitive Church.\n",
      "[315] Subsequent to this, in the time of one book-loving abbot, an addition of forty-nine volumes was made to the collection by his munificence and the diligence of his scribes; and time has allowed the modern bibliophile to gaze on a catalogue of these treasures.\n",

      "What indeed is the use of these things in which you say he spends his days--either at home, in the army, at the bar, in the cloister, in the church, in the court, or indeed in any position whatever, except, I suppose, the schools?\"\n",
      "His love of these undertakings, his industry in carrying them out, and the great talent he displayed in their restoration, is truly wonderful to observe.\n",
      "[357] Most readers have heard of Walter, (who was prior of St. Swithin in 1174,) giving twelve measures of barley and a pall, on which was embroidered in silver the history of St. Berinus converting a Saxon king, for a fine copy of Bede's Homilies and St. Austin's Psalter;[358] and of Henry, a monk of the Benedictine Abbey of Hyde, near there, who transcribed, in the year 1178, Terence, Boethius, Seutonius and Claudian; and richly illuminated and bound them, which he exchanged with a neighboring bibliophile for a life of St. Christopher, St. Gregory's Pastoral Care, and four Missals.\n",
      "Where is he who will maintain that the influence of the blessed and abundant charity--the cheering promises, and the sweet admonitions of love and mercy with which the Gospels overflow--aided nothing in the progress of civilization?\n",
      "How much will he trace to the Bible's influence; how often will he be compelled to enter a convent wall to find in the gospel student the one who shone as a redeeming light in those old days of iniquity and sin; and will he deny to the Christian priest his gratitude and love, because he wore the cowl and mantle of a monk, or because he loved to read of saints whose lives were mingled with lying legends, or because he chose a life which to us looks dreary, cold, and heartless.\n",
      "Will he deny him a grateful recollection when he reads of how much good he was permitted to achieve in the Church of Christ; of how many a doubting heart he reassured; of how many a soul he fired with a true spark of Christian love; when he reads of how the monk preached the faith of Christ, and how often he led some wandering pilgrim into the path of vital truth by the sweet words of the dear religion which he taught; when he reads that the hearts of many a Norman chief was softened by the sweetness of the gospel's voice, and his evil passions were lulled by the hymn of praise which the monk devoutly sang to his Master in heaven above.\n",
      "A creditable and right worthy testimonial this, of the learning and love of books prevalent among the monks of Ramsey Monastery.\n",
      "Monkish traditions say, that on one of these visits as the king approached, he heard the pious inmates of the monastery chanting their hymn of praise; and so melodious were the voices of the devotees, that his royal heart was touched, and he poured forth his feelings in a Saxon ballad, commencing thus: \"Merry sang the monks of Ely, When Canute the king was sailing by; Row ye knights near the land, And let us hear these monks song.\n",
      "\"This he assigned,\" says Matthew Paris, \"to the disposal of Abbot Paul, who was a lover of the Scriptures, for the transcription of the necessary volumes for the monastery.\n",
      "He himself indeed was a learned soldier, and a diligent hearer and lover of Scripture; to this he also added the tythes of Redburn, appointing certain provisions to be given to the scribes; this he did out of \"charity to the brothers that they may not thereby suffer, and that no impediment might be offered to the writers.\"\n",
      "During my search among the old manuscripts quoted in this work, this fact has been so repeatedly forced upon my attention that I am tempted to regard it as an important hint, and one which speaks favorably for the love of books and learning among the cowled devotees of the monasteries.\n",
      "[394] The matters in which he was concerned, his donations to the monastery, and the anecdotes of his life, are all unconnected with my subject; so that I am obliged to pass from this interesting monk, an undoubted bibliophile, from sheer want of information.\n",
      "He died in the year 1151, in the fourteenth of King Stephen, and was followed by Robert de Gorham, who is also commemorated as a bibliophile in the pages of the Cotton manuscripts; and to judge from his portrait, and the intensity with which he pores over his volume, he was a hard and devoted student.\n",
      "Aspiring to a holy life, he ardently hoped, by thus spending his days in monastic seclusion, to render his heart more acceptable to God.\n",
      "He was, says one, an especial lover of books, _librorum amator speciales_: and another in panegyric terms still further dubs him an _amator scripturarum_.\n",
      "There is a curious illumination of this monkish bibliophile in the Cotton manuscript.\n",
      "_Domus Dei est porta coeli_, said the monks; and when they closed the convent gates they did not look back on the world again, but entered on that dull and gloomy path with a full conviction that they were leaving all and following Christ, and so acting in accordance with his admonitions; but those who sought the convent to forget in its solitude their worldly cares and worldly disappointments, too often found how futile and how ineffectual was that dismal life to eradicate the grief of an overburdened heart, or to subdue the violence of misguided temper.\n",
      "By constant prayer the monk thought more of his God, and gained help to strengthen the faith within him; and by assiduous and devoted study he disciplined his heart of flesh--tore from it what lingering affection for the world remained, and deserting all love of earth and all love of kin, purged and purified it for his holy calling, and closed its portals to render it inaccessible to all sympathy of blood.\n",
      "\"Out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh;\" and the monks soon began to perceive with regret and trembling the worldly ways of the new abbot, which he could not hide even under his abbatical robes.\n",
      "In a place dedicated to holy deeds and heavenly thoughts, worldly conduct or unbridled passion strikes the mind as doubly criminal, and loads the heart with dismay and suffering; at least so my lord Prior regarded it, whose righteous indignation could no longer endure these manifestations of a worldly mind.\n",
      "Nor could the tears of the old man turn the heart of his cruel lord, nor the rebellious murmurings of the brothers avail.\n",
      "The monks, however, amidst all these troubles retained their love of books; indeed it was about this time that John de Basingstoke, who had studied at Athens, brought a valuable collection of Greek books into England, and greatly aided in diffusing a knowledge of that language into this country.\n",
      "But he was so excessively fond of books, and became so deeply engrossed with his book-collecting pursuits, that it is said some of the monks showed a little dissatisfaction at his consequent neglect of the affairs of the monastery; but these are faults I cannot find the heart to blame him for, but am inclined to consider his conduct fully redeemed by the valuable encouragement he gave to literature and learning.\n",
      "Their choice fell upon John Stokes, who presided over them for many years; but at his death the love and respect which the brothers entertained for Whethamstede, was manifested by unanimously electing him again, an honor which he in return could not find the heart to decline.\n",
      "But the intriguing heart of Beaufort soon resolved upon the most desperate measures, and shrunk not from staining his priestly hands with innocent and honorable blood.\n",
      "Deep was the murmuring and the grief of the people, for the good duke had won the love and esteem of their hearts; and we can fully believe a contemporary who writes-- \"Compleyne al Yngland thys goode Lorde's deth.\n"

      "The old monastic orders of St. Augustine and St. Benedict, of whose love of books we have principally spoken hitherto, were kept from falling into sloth and ignorance in the thirteenth century by the appearance of several new orders of devotees.\n",
      "The Dominicans,[438] the Franciscans,[439] and the Carmelites were each renowned for their profound learning, and their unquenchable passion for knowledge; assuming a garb of the most abject poverty, renouncing all love of the world, all participation in its temporal honors, and refraining to seek the aggrandizement of their order by fixed oblations or state endowments, but adhering to a voluntary system for support, they caused a visible sensation among all classes, and wrought a powerful change in the ecclesiastical and collegiate learning of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; and by their devotion, their charity, their strict austerity, and by their brilliant and unconquerable powers of disputation, soon gained the respect and affections of the people.\n",
      "Leland mentions some of those he found there, and among them some writings of Wicliff;[460] indeed those of this order were renowned far and wide for their love of study; look at the old portraits of a Dominican friar, and you will generally see him with the pen in one hand and a book in the other; but they were more ambitious in literature than the monks, and aimed at the honors of an author rather than at those of a scribe; but we are surprised more at their fertility than at their style or originality in the mysteries of bookcraft.\n",
      "[464] This diminution in religious zeal was naturally accompanied by a proportionate decrease in learning and love of study.\n",
      "Little did those barefooted priests know what an opponent to their Romish rites they were fostering into life; their love of learning and passion for books, drove all fear away; and the splendor of the new power so dazzled their eyes that they could not clearly see the nature of the refulgent light just bursting through the gloom of ages.\n",

      "The classical scholar will wish the holy monks had thought more about his darling authors of Greece and Rome; but the pious puritan historian blames them for patronizing the romantic allurements of Ovid, or the loose satires of Juvenal, and throws out some slanderous hint that they must have found a sympathy in those pages of licentiousness, or why so anxious to preserve them?\n",
      "Such being the case, let our hearts look charitably upon them; and whilst we pity them for their superstition, or blame them for their \"pious frauds,\" love them as brother men and workers in the mines of literature; such a course is far more honorable to the tenor of a christian's heart, than bespattering their memory with foul denunciations.\n",
      "It is these traits of worth and goodness that have gained my sympathies, and twined round my heart, and not the dark stains on the monkish page of history; these I have always striven to forget, or to remember them only when I thought experience might profit by them; for they offer a terrible lesson of blood, tyranny and anguish.\n",
      "But this dark and gloomy side is the one which from our infancy has ever been before us; we learnt it when a child from our tutor; or at college, or at school; we learnt it in the pages of our best and purest writers; learnt that in those old days nought existed, but bloodshed, tyranny, and anguish; but we never thought once to gaze at the scene behind, and behold the workings of human charity and love; if we had, we should have found that the same passions, the same affections, and the same hopes and fears existed then as now, and our sympathies would have been won by learning that we were reading of brother men, fellow Christians, and fellow-companions in the Church of Christ.\n",

      "Such being the case, let our hearts look charitably upon them; and whilst we pity them for their superstition, or blame them for their pious frauds, love them as brother men and workers in the mines of literature.\"\n",
      "The noble art of printing was unable, with all its rapid movements, to rescue from destruction the treasures of the monkish age; the advocates of the Reformation eagerly sought for and as eagerly destroyed those old popish volumes, doubtless there was much folly, much exaggerated superstition pervading them; but there was also some truth, a few facts worth knowing, and perhaps a little true piety also, and it would have been no difficult matter to have discriminated between the good and the bad.\n",
      "Doubtless, in the ruin of the sixteenth century, many original works of monkish authors perished, and the splendor of the transcript rendered it still more liable to destruction; but I confess, as old Fuller quaintly says, that \"there were many volumes full fraught with superstition which, notwithstanding, might be useful to learned men, except any will deny apothecaries the privilege of keeping poison in their shops, when they can make antidotes of them.\n",

      "How useful must Benedict's library have been in ripening the mind that was to cast a halo of immortality around that old monastery, and to generate a renown which was long to survive the grey walls of that costly fane; for whilst we now fruitlessly search for any vestiges of its former being, we often peruse the living pages of Bede the venerable with pleasure and instruction, and we feel refreshed by the breath of piety and devotion which they unfold; yet it must be owned the superstition of Rome will sometimes mar a devout prayer and the simplicity of a Christian thought.\n",
      "[316] The reader, I think, will allow that the catalogue enumerates but little unsuitable for a christian's study; he may not admire the principles contained in some of them, or the superstition with which many of them are loaded; but after all there were but few volumes among them from which a Bible reading monk might not have gleaned something good and profitable.\n",

      "Now all these facts thought of collectively--brought to bear one upon another--seem to favor the opinion my own study has deduced from them; that with all their superstition, with all their ignorance, their blindness to philosophic light--the monks of old were hearty lovers of books; that they encouraged learning, fostered and transcribed repeatedly the books which they had rescued from the destruction of war and time; and so kindly cherished and husbanded them as intellectual food for posterity.\n",
      "Such being the case, let our hearts look charitably upon them; and whilst we pity them for their superstition, or blame them for their \"pious frauds,\" love them as brother men and workers in the mines of literature; such a course is far more honorable to the tenor of a christian's heart, than bespattering their memory with foul denunciations.\n",
      "I have watched him in his little cell thus depicted on the ancient parchment, and have sympathized with his painful difficulties in acquiring true knowledge, or enlightened wisdom, within the convent walls; and then I have read the pages of his fellow monk--perhaps, his book-companion; and heard what _he_ had to say of that poor lonely Bible student, and have learnt with sadness how often truth had been extinguished from his mind by superstition, or learning cramped by his monkish prejudices; but it has not always been so, and I have enjoyed a more gladdening view on finding in the monk a Bible teacher; and in another, a profound historian, or pleasing annalist.\n",
      "But let it not be thought that if I have striven to retrieve from the dust and gloom of antiquity, the remembrance of old things that are worthy; that I feel any love for the superstition with which we find them blended.\n",
      "There is much that is good connected with those times; talent even that is worth imitating, and art that we may be proud to learn, which is beginning after the elapse of centuries to arrest the attention of the ingenious, and the love of these, naturally revive with the discovery; but we need not fear in this resurrection of old things of other days, that the superstition and weakness of the middle ages; that the veneration for dry bones and saintly dust, can live again.\n"

      "The persons are not named, but the business was to cull out all superstitious books, as missals, legends, and such like, and to deliver the garniture of the books, being either gold or silver, to Sir Anthony Aucher.\n",
      "As a bibliophile it is somewhat pleasing to trace a deep book passion growing up in the barrenness of the cloister, and to find in some cowled monk a bibliomaniac as warm and enthusiastic in his way as the renowned \"Atticus,\" or the noble Roxburghe, of more recent times.\n",
      "[23] We here catch a glimpse of the quiet life of a monkish student, who labored with this monotonous regularity to amass his little library.\n",
      "Hunter has printed[24] a list of books lent by the Convent of Henton, A. D. 1343, to a neighboring monastery, containing twenty volumes.\n",
      "Pagans they were, and therefore fit only to be named as infidels and dogs, so the monk was directed for a secular book, \"which some pagan wrote after making the general sign to scratch his ear with his hand, just as a dog itching would do with his feet, because infidels are not unjustly compared to such creatures--_quia nec immerito infideles tali animanti contparantur_.\n",
      "Indeed, to the instability of the fathers, as a sure guide, we may trace the origin of all those efforts of the human mind, which cleared the way for the Reformation, and relieved man from the shackles of these spiritual guides of the monks.\n",
      "The name that first attracts our attention in the early history of Canterbury Church is that of Theodore of Tarsus, the father of Anglo-Saxon literature, and certainly the first who introduced bibliomania into this island; for when he came on his mission from Rome in the year 668 he brought with him an extensive library, containing many Greek and Latin authors, in a knowledge of which he was thoroughly initiated.\n",
      "Having arrived there, they fixed on a wild and uncultivated site, and making a simple oratory of wattles for the temporary reception of their relics, they set zealously to work--for these old monks well knew what labor was--to cut down wood, to clear the ground, and build an habitation for themselves.\n",
      "This is a point worth observing on looking over the old parchment catalogues of the monks; for as by their Epistles we obtain a knowledge of their intimacy with the old writers, and the use they made of them, so by their catalogues we catch a glimpse of the means they possessed of becoming personally acquainted with their beauties; by the process much light may be thrown on the gloom of those long past times, and perhaps we shall gain too a better view of the state of learning existing then.\n",
      "It was during these commotions that Richard de Bury became a zealous partizan of the queen, to whom he fled, and ventured to supply her pecuniary necessities from the royal revenues; for this, however, he was surrounded with imminent danger; for the king, instituting an inquiry into these proceedings, attempted his capture, which he narrowly escaped by secreting himself in the belfry of the convent of Brothers Minor at Paris.\n",
      "During this time he twice undertook a visit to Italy, on a mission to the supreme pontiff, John XXII., who not only entertained him with honor and distinction, but appointed him chaplain to his principal chapel, and gave him a bull, nominating him to the first vacant see in England.\n",
      "\"Whether,\" he writes in one of his epistles, \"I am being shaved, or having my hair cut, whether I am riding on horseback or taking my meals, I either read myself or get some one to read to me; on the table where I dine, and by the side of my bed, I have all the materials for writing.\n",
      "De Bury, whilst negociating this affair, visited Antwerp and Brabant for the furtherance of the object of his mission, and he fully embraced this rare opportunity of adding to his literary stores, and returned to his fatherland well laden with many choice and costly manuscripts; for in all his perilous missions he carried about with him, as he tells us, that love of books which many waters could not extinguish, but which greatly sweetened the bitterness of peregrination.\n",
      "The modern bibliophiles who know what it is to revel in the enjoyment of a goodly library, luxuriant in costly bindings and rich in bibliographical rarities, who are fully susceptible to the delights and exquisite sensibilities of that sweet madness called bibliomania, will readily comprehend the multiplied pleasures of that early and illustrious bibliophile in the seclusion of Auckland Palace; he there ardently applied his energies and wealth to the accumulation of books; and whilst engaged in this pleasing avocation, let us endeavor to catch a glimpse of him.\n",
      "Chambre, to whom we are indebted for many of the above particulars, tells us that Richard de Bury was learned in the governing of his house, hospitable to strangers, of great charity, and fond of disputation with the learned, but he principally delighted in a multitude of books, _Iste summe delectabatur multitudine librorum_,[182] and possessed more books than all the bishops put together, an assertion which requires some modification, and must not be too strictly regarded, for book collecting at that time was becoming a favorite pursuit; still the language of Chambre is expressive, and clearly proves how extensive must have been his libraries, one of which he formed in each of his various palaces, _diversis maneriis_.\n",
      "\"[194] In the seventh chapter of his work, he deplores the sad destruction of books by war and fire, and laments the loss of the 700,000 volumes, which happened in the Alexandrian expedition; but the eighth chapter is the one which the bibliomaniac will regard with the greatest interest, for Richard de Bury tells us there how he collected together his rich and ample library.\n",
      "[195] Wherefore, when supported by the bounty of the aforesaid prince of worthy memory, we were enabled to oppose or advance, to appoint or discharge; crazy quartos and tottering folios, precious however in our sight as well as in our affections, flowed in most rapidly from the great and the small, instead of new year's gift and remunerations, and instead of presents and jewels.\n",
      "or the wild Romances of Chivalry which enlivened the halls and cots of our forefathers in Gothic days.\n",
      "There are few monastic libraries whose progress we can trace with so much satisfaction as the one now under consideration, for we have another catalogue compiled during the librarianship of John Tyshbourne, in the year 1416,[210] in which many errors appearing in the former ones are carefully corrected; books which subsequent to that time had been lost or stolen are here accounted for; many had been sent to the students at Oxford, and others have notes appended, implying to whom the volume had been lent; thus to a \"_Flores Bernardi_,\" occurs \"_Prior debit, I Kempe Episcopi Londoni_.\"\n",
      "[235] Let the reader examine Leland's Collect., and the Catalogues printed in Hunter's Tract on Monastic Libraries.\n",
      "[256] But I am not about to pursue his history, or to attempt to show how his hot and imperious temper, or the pride and avarice of his disposition, wrought many grievous animosities in the Saxon church; or how by his prelatical ambition he deservedly lost the friendship of his King and his ecclesiastical honors.\n",
      "In the year 710, a dispute having occurred among the western church of the Saxons, he was appointed to undertake a mission to the archbishop of Canterbury on the subject.\n",
      "Heedless of the danger of the expedition, but looking forward only to the consummation of his fond design, he started on his missionary enterprise, accompanied by one or two of his monkish brethren.\n",
      "After an interval of two years we find him again starting on another Christian mission.\n",
      "On reaching France he proceeded immediately to Rome, and procured admission to the Pope, who, ever anxious for the promulgation of the faith and for the spiritual dominion of the Roman church, highly approved of the designs of Boniface, and gave him letters authorizing his mission among the Thuringians; invested with these powers and with the pontifical blessing, he took his departure from the holy city, well stored with the necessary ornaments and utensils for the performance of the ecclesiastical rites, besides a number of books to instruct the heathens and to solace his mind amidst the cares and anxieties of his travels.\n",
      "He who would wish to trace more fully these events, and so catch a glimpse of the various incidents which touch upon the current of his life, must not keep the monk constantly before his mind, he must sometimes forget him in that capacity and regard him as a _student_, and that too in the highest acceptation of the term.\n",
      "But if obscurity hangs around his birth, so soon as he steps into the paths of learning and ranks with the students of his day, we are no longer in doubt or perplexity; but are able from that period to his death to trace the occurrences of his life with all the ease that a searcher of monkish history can expect.\n",
      "[273] So much was he esteemed by his master the archbishop, that he entrusted him with a mission to Rome, to receive from the hands of the Pope his pall; on his return he called at Parma, where he had an interview with Charles the Great; who was so captivated with his eloquence and erudition that he eagerly entreated him to remain, and to aid in diffusing throughout his kingdom the spirit of that knowledge which he had so successfully acquired in the Saxon monasteries.\n",
      "But Alcuin was equally anxious for the advancement of literature in his own country; and being then on a mission connected with his church, he could do no more than hold out a promise of consulting his superiors, to whose decisions he considered himself bound to submit.\n",
      "\"I was prepared,\" says he, \"to come to you with the presents of King Charles, and to return to my country; but it seemed more advisable to me for the peace of my nation to remain abroad; not knowing what I could have done among those persons with whom no man can be secure or able to proceed in any laudable pursuit.\n",
      "Blessed are they that keep my ways, and blessed is the man that heareth me._' Continue, then, my Lord King, to exhort the young in the palaces of your highness to earnest pursuit in acquiring wisdom; that they may be honored in their old age, and ultimately enter into a blessed immortality.\n",
      "We are unable to trace distinctly the formation of the monastic library of Whitby.\n",
      "It is pleasant, however, to trace these workings of bibliomania in the monasteries; and it is a surprise quite agreeable and delicious in itself to meet with instances like the present.\n"

      "Printers.... 118 Fulton Street ... New York Bibliomania in the Middle Ages OR SKETCHES OF BOOKWORMS, COLLECTORS, BIBLE STUDENTS, SCRIBES AND ILLUMINATORS _From the Anglo-Saxon and Norman Periods to the Introduction of Printing into England, with Anecdotes Illustrating the History of the Monastic Libraries of Great Britain in the Olden Time by_ F. Somner Merryweather, _with an Introduction by_ Charles Orr, _Librarian of Case Library._ INTRODUCTION.\n",
      "Mr. Merryweather, whose book, as has been intimated, is only a defense of bibliomania itself as it actually existed in the middle ages, gives the reader but scant information as to processes of book-making at that time.\n",
      "Its publication followed shortly after that of the works of Digby and Maitland, but shows much original research and familiarity with early authorities; and it is much more than either of these, or of any book with which we are acquainted, a plea in defense of bibliomania in the middle ages.\n",
      "It may surprise some, however, that an attempt should be made to prove that, in the olden time in \"merrie Englande,\" a passion which Dibdin has christened Bibliomania, existed then, and that there were many cloistered bibliophiles as warm and enthusiastic in book collecting as the Doctor himself.\n",
      "I would show the means then in existence of acquiring knowledge, the scarcity or plentitude of books, the extent of their libraries, and the rules regulating them; and bring forward those facts which tend to display the general routine of a literary monk, or the prevalence of Bibliomania in those days.\n",
      "As may be supposed, the monkish librarians often became great bibliophiles, for being in constant communication with choice manuscripts, they soon acquired a great mania for them.\n",
      "To this we are indebted for all the good that resulted from those various heterodoxies and heresies, which sometimes disturbed the church during the dark ages; but which wrought much ultimate good by compelling the thoughts of men to dwell on these important matters.\n",
      "The name that first attracts our attention in the early history of Canterbury Church is that of Theodore of Tarsus, the father of Anglo-Saxon literature, and certainly the first who introduced bibliomania into this island; for when he came on his mission from Rome in the year 668 he brought with him an extensive library, containing many Greek and Latin authors, in a knowledge of which he was thoroughly initiated.\n",
      "He entered the Abbey, and devoted his whole time to reading the wondrous lives and miracles of ascetic men till his mind became excited to a state of insanity by the many marvels and prodigies which they unfolded; so that he acquired among the simple monks the reputation of one holding constant and familiar intercourse with the beings of another world.\n",
      "[124] He wrote a book beginning, \"_Memoriale Henerici Prioris Monasteri Xpi Cantuariæ_,\"[125] now preserved in the Cotton collection; it contains the most extensive monastic catalogue I had ever seen, and sufficiently proves how Bibliomania flourished in that noble monastery.\n",
      "Surprise and wonder almost surpass the admiration we feel at beholding this proud testimonial of monkish industry and early bibliomania.\n",
      "[132] William Sellinge, who was a man of erudition, and deeply imbued with the book-loving mania, was elected prior in 1472.\n",
      "[133] I have said enough, I think, to show that books were eagerly sought after, and deeply appreciated, in Canterbury cloisters during the middle ages, and when the reader considers that these facts have been preserved from sheer accident, and, therefore, only enable us to obtain a partial glimpse of the actual state of their library, he will be ready to admit that bibliomania existed then, and will feel thankful, too, that it did, for to its influence, surely, we are indebted for the preservation of much that is valuable and instructive in history and general literature.\n",
      "The modern bibliophiles who know what it is to revel in the enjoyment of a goodly library, luxuriant in costly bindings and rich in bibliographical rarities, who are fully susceptible to the delights and exquisite sensibilities of that sweet madness called bibliomania, will readily comprehend the multiplied pleasures of that early and illustrious bibliophile in the seclusion of Auckland Palace; he there ardently applied his energies and wealth to the accumulation of books; and whilst engaged in this pleasing avocation, let us endeavor to catch a glimpse of him.\n",

      "Richard de Wallingford, who was then abbot, convoked the elder monks _convocatis senioribus_, and discussed with them, as to the most effectual way to obtain the goodwill and favor of de Bury; after due consideration it was decided that no gift was likely to prove so acceptable to that father of English bibliomania as a present of some of their choice books, and it was at last agreed to send four volumes, \"that is to say Terence, a Virgil, a Quintilian, and Jerome against Ruffinus,\" and to sell him many others from their library; this they sent him intimation of, and a purchase was ultimately agreed upon between them.\n"

      "Whethamstede ordered a Grael to be written so beautifully illuminated, and so superbly bound, as to be valued at the enormous sum of twenty pounds: but let it be remembered that my Lord Abbot was a very epicure in books, and thought a great deal of choice bindings, tall copies, immaculate parchment, and brilliant illuminations, and the high prices which he freely gave for these book treasures evince how sensible he was to the joys of bibliomania; nor am I inclined to regard the works thus attained as \"mere monastic trash.\n",

      "While the wretched man's heart is thus filled with woe and only the sorrowing Muses bedew their cheeks with tears, in his strait is heard on every side the wailing appeal to us, and to avoid the danger of impending death he shows the slight sign of the ancient tonsure which we bestowed upon him, begging that we may be called to his aid and bear witness to the privilege bestowed upon him.\n",

      "Wherefore, that the order of Preachers was principally instituted for the study of the Holy Scriptures and the salvation of their neighbours, is declared by their constitutions, so that not only from the rule of Bishop Augustine, which directs books to be asked for every day, but as soon as they have read the prologue of the said constitutions they may know from the very title of the same that they are pledged to the love of books.\n",
      "Because of these three things, we books, who have ever procured their advancement and have granted them to sit among the powerful and noble, are put far from their heart's affection and are reckoned as superfluities; except that they rely upon some treatises of small value, from which they derive strange heresies and apocryphal imbecilities, not for the refreshment of souls, but rather for tickling the ears of the listeners.\n",

      "In fact, the fame of our love of them had been soon winged abroad everywhere, and we were reported to burn with such desire for books, and especially old ones, that it was more easy for any man to gain our favour by means of books than of money.\n",
      "Wherefore, since supported by the goodness of the aforesaid prince of worthy memory, we were able to requite a man well or ill, to benefit or injure mightily great as well as small, there flowed in, instead of presents and guerdons, and instead of gifts and jewels, soiled tracts and battered codices, gladsome alike to our eye and heart.\n",
      "Besides all this, we were frequently made ambassador of this most illustrious Prince of everlasting memory, and were sent on the most various affairs of state, now to the Holy See, now to the Court of France, and again to various powers of the world, on tedious embassies and in times of danger, always carrying with us, however, that love of books which many waters could not quench.\n",

      "For we never regarded with disdain or disgust the poverty of the mendicant orders, adopted for the sake of Christ; but in all parts of the world took them into the kindly arms of our compassion, allured them by the most friendly familiarity into devotion to ourselves, and having so allured them cherished them with munificent liberality of beneficence for the sake of God, becoming benefactors of all of them in general in such wise that we seemed none the less to have adopted certain individuals with a special fatherly affection.\n",

      "Just snatched from the cradle and hastily weaned, they mouth the rules of Priscian and Donatus; while still beardless boys they gabble with childish stammering the Categorics and Peri Hermeneias, in the writing of which the great Aristotle is said to have dipped his pen in his heart's blood.\n",
      "Wherefore, although the over-mastering love of books has possessed our mind from boyhood, and to rejoice in their delights has been our only pleasure, yet the appetite for the books of the civil law took less hold of our affections, and we have spent but little labour and expense in acquiring volumes of this kind.\n",
      "We have noticed a certain manifest difference of nature between law and science, in that every science is delighted and desires to open its inward parts and display the very heart of its principles, and to show forth the roots from which it buds and flourishes, and that the emanation of its springs may be seen of all men; for thus from the cognate and harmonious light of the truth of conclusion to principles, the whole body of science will be full of light, having no part dark.\n",

      "Love, says Jerome, the knowledge of the scriptures, and thou wilt not love the vices of the flesh.\n",
      "Again, all who are smitten with the love of books think cheaply of the world and wealth; as Jerome says to Vigilantius: The same man cannot love both gold and books.\n",
      "And thus it has been said in verse: No iron-stained hand is fit to handle books, Nor he whose heart on gold so gladly looks: The same men love not books and money both, And books thy herd, O Epicurus, loathe; Misers and bookmen make poor company, Nor dwell in peace beneath the same roof-tree.\n",
      "Thence by books we pass on to separate substances, that the intellect may greet kindred intelligences, and with the mind's eye may discern the First Cause of all things and the Unmoved Mover of infinite virtue, and may immerse itself in love without end.\n",
      "The felicitous studiousness and the studious felicity of the all-powerful eunuch, of whom we are told in the Acts, who had been so mightily kindled by the love of the prophetic writings that he ceased not from his reading by reason of his journey, had banished all thought of the populous palace of Queen Candace, and had forgotten even the treasures of which he was the keeper, and had neglected alike his journey and the chariot in which he rode.\n",

      "CHAPTER XX AN EXHORTATION TO SCHOLARS TO REQUITE US BY PIOUS PRAYERS Time now clamours for us to terminate this treatise which we have composed concerning the love of books; in which we have endeavoured to give the astonishment of our contemporaries the reason why we have loved books so greatly.\n",
      "But because it is hardly granted to mortals to accomplish aught that is not rolled in the dust of vanity, we do not venture entirely to justify the zealous love which we have so long had for books, or to deny that it may perchance sometimes have been the occasion of some venial negligence, albeit the object of our love is honourable and our intention upright.\n",

      "Our purity of race is diminished every day, while new authors' names are imposed upon us by worthless compilers, translators, and transformers, and losing our ancient nobility, while we are reborn in successive generations, we become wholly degenerate; and thus against our will the name of some wretched stepfather is affixed to us, and the sons are robbed of the names of their true fathers.\n",

      "Wherefore the memory of those fathers should be immortal, who delighted only in the treasures of wisdom, who most laboriously provided shining lamps against future darkness, and against hunger of hearing the Word of God, most carefully prepared, not bread baked in the ashes, nor of barley, nor musty, but unleavened loaves made of the finest wheat of divine wisdom, with which hungry souls might be joyfully fed These men were the stoutest champions of the Christian army, who defended our weakness by their most valiant arms; they were in their time the most cunning takers of foxes, who have left us their nets, that we might catch the young foxes, who cease not to devour the growing vines.\n",

      "Himself an indefatigable collector of books, the possessor of a library as valuable as it was interesting, a library containing volumes obtained only at the cost of great personal sacrifice, he was in the most active sympathy with the disease called bibliomania, and knew, as few comparatively poor men have known, the half-pathetic, half-humorous side of that incurable mental infirmity.\n",

      "Oh, I should bind this priceless prize In bindings full and fine, And keep her where no human eyes Should see her charms, but mine!” In “Dear Old London” the poet wailed that “a splendid Horace cheap for cash” laughed at his poverty, and in “Dibdin's Ghost” he revelled in the delights that await the bibliomaniac in the future state, where there is no admission to the women folk who, “wanting victuals, make a fuss if we buy books instead”; while in “Flail, Trask and Bisland” is the very essence of bibliomania, the unquenchable thirst for possession.\n",
      "And yet, despite these self-accusations, bibliophily rather than bibliomania would be the word to characterize his conscientious purpose.\n",
      "The mania for books kept him continually buying; the love of books supervened to make them a part of himself and his life.\n",

      "Indeed, my learned friend Dr. O'Rell has met with several cases (as he informs me) in which suppressed bibliomania has resulted fatally.\n",
      "To make short of a long story, the medical faculty is nearly a unit upon the proposition that wherever suppressed bibliomania is suspected immediate steps should be taken to bring out the disease.\n",
      "It is true that an Ohio physician, named Woodbury, has written much in defence of the theory that bibliomania can be aborted; but a very large majority of his profession are of the opinion that the actual malady must needs run a regular course, and they insist that the cases quoted as cured by Woodbury were not genuine, but were bastard or false phases, of the same class as the chickenpox and the German measles.\n",

      "Or, if you cannot procure copies of that work, it may serve your purpose to know that the doctor's theory is to this effect —viz., that bibliomania does not deserve the name of bibliomania until it is exhibited in the second stage.\n",
      "For secondary bibliomania there is no known cure; the few cases reported as having been cured were doubtless not bibliomania at all, or, at least, were what we of the faculty call false or chicken bibliomania.\n",

      "“But properly treated,” continues Dr. O'Rell, “and particularly if his spiritual needs be ministered to, he can be brought safely through this period of collapse into a condition of reenforced exaltation, which is the true, or secondary stage of, bibliomania, and for which there is no cure known to humanity.” I should trust Dr. O'Rell's judgment in this matter, even if I did not know from experience that it was true.\n",
      "For Dr. O'Rell is the most famous authority we have in bibliomania and kindred maladies.\n",
      "It is he (I make the information known at the risk of offending the ethics of the profession) —it is he who discovered the bacillus librorum, and, what is still more important and still more to his glory, it is he who invented that subtle lymph which is now everywhere employed by the profession as a diagnostic where the presence of the germs of bibliomania (in other words, bacilli librorum) is suspected.\n",
      "I think it was while we were in London and while we were deep in the many fads of bibliomania that we arrived at this important conclusion.\n",
      "We regard Grangerism as one of the unfortunate stages in bibliomania; it is a period which seldom covers more than five years, although Dr. O'Rell has met with one case in his practice that has lasted ten years and still gives no symptom of abating in virulence.\n",
      "Bibliomania is beautiful as an entirety, as a symmetrical blending of a multitude of component parts, and he is indeed disloyal to the cause who, through envy or shortsightedness or ignorance, argues to the discredit of angling, or Napoleonana, or balladry, or Indians, or Burns, or Americana, or any other branch or phase of bibliomania; for each of these things accomplishes a noble purpose in that each contributes to the glory of the great common cause of bibliomania, which is indeed the summum bonum of human life.\n",

      "As the angler whose patience is fortified with the thoughts of the pecuniary value of his catch, is regarded by his brother Waltoniansthat is to say, with derision and contempt- so is the hungry book-hunter who buys to sell again at a profit, and whose whole soul is absorbed in the contemplation of prospective gain.\n",
      "Let it not be supposed, therefore, that although it is the province of the true book-hunter to find value in those things which in the eye of the ordinary possessor are really worthless, his ambition is grovelling or his hopes mercenary ; on the contrary, the \" value \" of a book to him lies in the nature of the contents, or perhaps in its history or in that of the man who wrote it, or in the special circumstances which give it an importance and a place upon his shelves .\n",
      "Between the lover of books for their own sake and the mere book- hunter there is indeed a wide distinction , and the former perhaps needs to be reminded occasionally that there is such a thing as trade in books, and that there are plenty of genuine book-hunters who will without compunction send whole rows of life's companions to the block.\n",

      "The books they hunt after so laboriously, and buy from the dealer at great cost, or occasionally from the stalls for less than the market value, are indicative of the motive which prompted the purchase, and in a large number of cases this may be summed up in a single phrase-expectancy of gain.\n",
      "One MS. on vellum, descriptive of the Arms of the Knights of the Round Table, brought £36 ; Bellenden's \" Croniklis of Scotland,\" £65 ; a copy of the first folio of Shakespeare's complete works, 1623, brought £100, while the Marquis of Blandford broke all previous records and constituted himself the pioneer of the modern book-hunter by writing out a cheque for £2260, that being the figure at which a copy of Valdarfer's Boccaccio of 1471 was knocked down.\n",

      "When a book-hunter happens to come across a single piece (never mind collected works unless almost contemporary with the author) , particularly if in small quarto, let him consider whether the edition is original or not.\n",
      "Even a volume of sermons may be an object of intense interest to the book-hunter if the contents are in any way associated with a religious revolution in which the author was a prominent figure.\n",
      "As matters stand, it is perfectly obvious that the book-hunter must make up his mind to almost ignore the fashion as it exists to-day, and to peer into the future, to collect for the future, to talk chiefly of the future.\n",
      "On the contrary, quickness of perception , and an aptitude for taking any opportunity which Providence may see fit to throw in our way, is part of the book- hunter's training, and he would be a sorry hunter indeed without these essentials to success.\n",
      "This advice points away from the beaten track in the direction of new paths, some of which, if well chosen, may eventually become thoroughfares.\n",
      "Hence it follows that the experienced bookhunter has acquired the habit of opening every book he sees ; he does so somewhat abstractedly in many cases, but the early training which prompts the act is apparent in every gesture.\n",
      "Writing to Coleridge, he says, \" A book reads the better which is our own and has been so long known to us that we know the topography of its blots and dog's-ears, and can trace the dirt in it to having read it at tea with buttered muffins, or over a pipe, which I think is the maximum.\"\n",

      "An experienced book-hunter never permits a volume of tracts to pass through his hands without examination.\n",
      "When his books came to be sold, it was found that time had curbed his hand, and had been much too short to enable him to complete even a section of his library, truly described by a hunter after unconsidered trifles as a thing of shreds and patches.\n",

      "Although I belonged to a literary family, none of my ancestors had been smitten by the bibliomania or other cognate passion, simply because at first our resources were of the most limited character, and my grandfather was a man of letters and nothing more.\n",
      "I cannot believe the great poet to have been a bibliophile like Jonson.\n",
      "He bought the wrong copies, or he allowed the right ones to be massacred by a pagan binder; but he was a book-lover.\n",
      "His alliance by marriage to the Reynells introduced another stage in our bibliographical evolution.\n",
      "My mother's brother, Mr Charles Weatherby Reynell, of whom I have so much to say elsewhere, was not only a book-buyer on a modest scale, but a gentleman with a vague, undefined liking for anything which struck him as quaint and curious--a coin, a piece of china, a picture, a bit of old painted glass, a Chippendale chair--it hardly signified what it was; but books had the first place, I think, in his heart, and he knew a good deal about such as he had purchased, and thought a good deal about them too, albeit they were, as copies, hardly calculated for the meridian of the fastidious connoisseur.\n",
      "Books, as they were my father's only, and my uncle's chief, paramours, were my first love.\n",
      "He was a person who had a genuine love for our older literature, and enjoyed even better opportunities than my father of indulging it.\n",
      "It has sometimes appeared to me, however, that the general public looks with modified respect on this class of venture, more especially as it does not share the profits; and what is absolutely certain is, that the whole system of treating literature from a commercial point of view is narrowing and lowering, and tends to harden, if not to extinguish, that fine sensibility which is proper to the bibliophile.\n"

      "I should be truly ashamed if I had to confess that with the actual proprietary interest in the literary or bibliographical rarities which I have had through my hands during the last forty years my substantial affection for the subject-matter and the authors began and ended.\n",

      "I turn again and again to his sale catalogue, and amid much that is dry and monotonous enough I am never weary of perusing the notes, chiefly from his own pen, where he places on permanent record the circumstances, often romantic and fascinating, under which he gained possession of this or that volume.\n",
      "No class of anecdote can be more enduringly valuable in the eyes of the bibliophile than those with which the work under consideration is so unstintingly enriched, and I may not be blamed for exemplifying and justifying by some typical specimens my estimate of Heber's scholarship and energy.\n",
      "Under 'Bevis of Hampton,' Heber notes, 'For an account of the Romance of Bevis see Ritson's _Dissertation_, prefixed to his _Metrical Romances_,' and he copies out what is found there.\n",

      "Of _Pierceforest_, of which he possessed the edition by Giles Gourmont, 1531-2, in folio, Heber speaks as follows: 'This is a Romance of great Character, value and merit.\n",
      "Mr Warton, upon whatever authority, asserts it to have been originally written in verse about 1220, and not till many years afterwards translated into prose, an assertion which cannot be confirmed; no MS. of any Metrical Romance under that title appearing to be anywhere extant, and indeed it is probable that he confounded _Pierceforest_ with _Perceval_.\n",
      "In his copy of Tatham's _Ostella_, 1650, he draws our attention to the author's Ode to Lovelace on his journey into Holland, and adds, 'It must have been written before his marriage.\n",
      "My association with the London Library and gradual contact with the British Museum, with collectors, and with the book trade, tended to stimulate a natural affection for old books, while it gradually and, at first, unconsciously gave to the movement a bibliographical and commercial direction.\n",
      "The ancient Spanish romance, the early German book with woodcuts, were well represented.\n",
      "The best part of his library consisted of books which he had purchased from his connexion by marriage, and which the latter had obtained more or less accidentally in the course of his prolonged career.\n",
      "In my ardour for organising my own _Bibliography_ on an enlarged and exhaustive footing, I jesuitically availed myself of the periodical consignments of books to Riviere for binding; and, with the leave of the latter, took notes of everything in his hands.\n",
      "I cherish, with a gratification never to be lessened or forgotten, the memory of this delightful intercourse with one whose people had known my people in the days gone by, and who, besides being a collector of old books, had made himself a master, like Heber, of the contents; and who, as a younger man, enjoyed the genteel recreation of angling, and in his maturer life relished good wine and good talk.\n",
      "Sixty rare pamphlets went to Mr Huth at as many guineas; the British Museum purchased several; and a literary coal merchant, who had just then been providentially inspired with an ardour for the monuments of the Civil War period, gave me £20 for the refuse.\n",
      "As a young man, he resided at Gibraltar, and he told me that he had there an intrigue with a Spanish beauty, the unexpected advent or return of whose husband necessitated her lover's desperate leap out of the window.\n",

      "I contented myself with writing him a line, to intimate that I had not the volume, and that I thought when he found it, he would be sorry that he had expressed his views in such a manner.\n",
      "He eyed it rather wistfully; the low price was somewhat against it; but he accepted it, and fortunately or otherwise he did not take its counsel practically to heart.\n",
      "He was an exceptionally shrewd and vigilant character, and nearly broke Lovejoy of Reading's heart by getting from his assistant an uncut copy of Ruskin's poems for a shilling during Lovejoy's absence.\n",
      "I applied for the lots; _they brought them to me_; they were in splendid state; I clapped them in my pocket, and I left the place with a lightened heart.\n",
      "It was in the original vellum wrapper, and must have been reduced to its actual degradation by excess of affection or of neglect.\n",
      "I refer to two letters from Sir Christopher Hatton in his own hand to a lady, couched in most familiar and affectionate terms, and subscribed with the same fictitious signature as Hatton employed in corresponding with the Queen herself.\n",
      "This was a tissue of romantic inventions on the part, not of the auctioneer, I apprehend, but on that of the ingenious and candid owner, who was rewarded for his pains by seeing his property fetch £100!\n",
      "I shall always cherish a sentiment of gratitude toward Mr Quaritch for his valuable aid during a whole decade in putting it in my power to present in instalments the fruit of my labour at the auction-rooms and elsewhere, and in agreeing to defray the entire cost of the _General Index_ to a large portion of it.\n",
      "Of my publishers I am scarcely entitled to speak in a volume devoted to the collecting side beyond such works as directly arose from my pursuit as a book-lover pure and simple between 1857 and 1867.\n",
      "Both the stories just mentioned were there for the first time presented in an English form and text agreeably to my view and estimate of the facts relative to two of the most remarkable characters in romance.\n",

      "Diamond contracted in later days a fancy for Queen Anne silver, and grew enamoured of the rat-tailed spoon; and a second friend, whose employments took him all over the country and into provincial towns, before the great change occurred, and everything gravitated to London, has related to me a series of stories of his fortunes as an occasional collector.\n",
      "It was growing toward the close of the scene; whatever the plea might have been for the prior line, it was at any rate pursued with ardour and consistency; the owner's heart and soul were in it; it was a sort of religion with him; he believed in it, as his associates believed in him, and identified him and his name, and his home, with the subject.\n",
      "He was not guiltless of an affection for bargains, and never, I believe, went higher than 10s.\n",
      "Antiquities in metal-work have their share of romance.\n",
      "The result was momentous in this sense, that I saw at the shop mentioned a 'butcher's' penny, which bore the same relation to the inmates of the bag as an immaculate copy of a book or a faultless piece of china bears to the most indifferent specimens imaginable; and I handed half-a-crown to Lincoln for his coin, which I took home with a rather full heart.\n",
      "It may give some idea of my disinterested, perhaps enviable, ardour, if I mention that I revisited Milan, at the expense of a long detour, to get a silver coin of one of the Medici, which I considered on second thoughts worth having at nine _lire_.\n",
      "One person used, during quite a lengthened period, to select with unerring judgment from every sale in Wellington Street the best lot, and when he was at last detected, his genuine ardour was shown by the fact, that the whole of his selections were found at his residence intact.\n"

      "I may more emphatically specify, as falling within such a definition, the examples engraved and described by my correspondent, Count Nicolò Papadopoli, in his _Monete Italiane Inedite_, 1893, the major part of which come very far short of my personal ideas of works of art, but of which the affectionate custody by posterity becomes a duty on historical grounds.\n",

      "It is my impression, based on a long experience, that about three hundred Greek coins of all varieties and types will be found to embrace everything of real note, and will provide the possessor with numismatic specimens in all metals, of every region, of every period and style, of each denomination, and of all such great personalities as are known to have struck money, not only within the limits of European Greece, but in the countries and colonies subject to its sovereigns in their varied degrees of power and prosperity or by its cities from their first rude development to their zenith in political influence and commercial wealth.\n",

      "Mr. Westell first began in a small shop in Bozier's Court, Tottenham Court Road, and this shop has been immortalized by Lord Lytton in 'My Novel,' for it is here that Leonard Fairfield's friendly bookseller was situated.\n",
      "[201:A] Bozier's Court was a sort of eddy from the constant stream which passes in and out of Oxford Street, and many pleasant hours have been spent in the court by book-lovers.\n",
      "During Mr. Turnbull's tenancy in Bozier's Court several rivals started round about him; but one after another failed to make it pay, and retired, leaving him eventually in entire possession.\n",
      "At the sign of the White Greyhound, in St. Paul's Churchyard, the first editions of Shakespeare's 'Venus and Adonis' and 'Rape of Lucrece' were published by John Harrison; at the Fleur de Luce and the Crown appeared the first edition of the 'Merry Wives of Windsor'; at the Green Dragon the first edition of the 'Merchant of Venice'; at the Fox the first edition of 'Richard II.\n",
      "The most famous bibliopole who had a shop in Ludgate is perhaps William Hone, to whom the liberty of the press owes so much, and who removed here from his house at the corner of Ship Court, Old Bailey.\n",
      "At the latter part of the sixteenth century Thomas Marsh, of the Prince's Arms, near St. Dunstan's, issued Stow's 'Chronicles,' and was the holder of several licenses for printing; for nearly half a century J. Smethwicke (who died in 1641) had a shop 'under the diall' of St. Dunstan's, whence he issued Shakespeare's 'Hamlet,' 'Love's Labour Lost,' 'Romeo and Juliet,' 'Taming of the Shrew,' as well as works by Henry Burton, Drayton, Greene, Lodge, and others; Richard Marriot was in St. Dunstan's Churchyard early in the seventeenth century, and his ventures included Quarles' 'Emblems,' 1635, Dr. Downes' 'Sermons,' 1640, and Walton's 'Compleat Angler,' 1653, for which 1s.\n",
      "It always contained an immense variety of good and useful books, priced at exceedingly moderate amounts, and the poorer book-lover could always venture, generally successfully, on suggesting a small reduction in the prices marked without being trampled in the dust as a thief and a robber.\n",
      "Marsh (who afterwards removed to a shop now swallowed by the improvements in Northumberland Avenue, Charing Cross) was situated at Cicero's Head, in New Round Court, off the Strand, and is described by one who knew him as being afflicted with 'a very unhappy temper, and withal very proud and insolent, with a plentiful share of conceit.'\n",
      "'Honest Tom Payne' started business in or about 1740, for in February of that year he issued a catalogue of 'curious books in divinity, history, classics, medicine, voyages, natural history,' etc., from the 'Round Court,[237:B] in the Strand, opposite York [238]Buildings.'\n",
      "Just before leaving Round Court, Tom Payne issued a sort of clearance catalogue, comprising 10,000 volumes, 'which will be sold very cheap.'\n",
      "Tom Payne (who was a native of Brackley) came into possession of his famous shop at the Mews' Gate through his marriage with Elizabeth Taylor, whose brother built and for some time occupied it.\n",
      "Many wondered, and some remonstrated; but Mr. Thorpe was master of his own mint, and he never mentions the circumstance but with perfect confidence, and even gaiety of heart, at its success.'\n",
      "Subsequently they occupied not only the whole of the side, but such portion of the other as was not occupied by the Court of Common Pleas, which then sat within the hall itself, as did the Chancery and King's Bench at its farther end.\n",
      "When he first came to London, he worked as a printer at Watts', in Wild's Court, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he had the frame which had been occupied by Benjamin Franklin.\n",
      "Toovey's shop at 177, Piccadilly (once occupied by William Pickering, the famous publisher), was for about forty years a favourite haunt of booksellers, for Toovey was a bibliophile as well as a bibliopole.\n",
      "There is not much that is architecturally beautiful about Mr. Quaritch's shop at 15, Piccadilly, but its interest to the book-lover needs but little emphasis after what has been said.\n",
      "[201:A]'One day [writes Lytton] three persons were standing before an old bookstall in a passage leading from Oxford Street into Tottenham Court Road.\n",
      "The only English name, in fact, worthy to be classed with the foregoing is that of Queen Elizabeth, who, in addition to her passion for beautiful books, may also be regarded as a genuine book-lover and reader.\n",
      "For all practical purposes, Queen Elizabeth may be regarded as the first distinguished femme bibliophile.\n",
      "During the eighteenth century, the taste for books was by no means uncommon among women, although only a bold man would declare that that period produced a genuine femme bibliophile.\n",
      "It was in three volumes, each of which had a separate dedication; the first is addressed to the Countess of Burlington, the second to Mrs. Bovey, a learned and very beautiful widow, by some supposed to be identical with Sir Roger de Coverley's obdurate veuve, whilst the third, in a strain of loyal and affectionate eulogy, is to Steele's own wife, who may be supposed to be depicted in Du Guernier's frontispiece in the first volume.\n",
      "Queen Caroline, the consort of George II., was an enthusiastic bibliophile.\n",
      "Miss Currer, who suffered from deafness, was an intimate friend of Richard Heber, and it was rumoured at one time that this distinguished bibliomaniac was engaged to be married to Miss Currer, but the [269]event did not transpire.\n",
      "Mrs. Rylands' career as a femme bibliophile may be briefly summarised thus: In 1889 this lady formed the plan of erecting in Manchester a memorial to her late husband, which should embody one main purpose of his life, as carried out by him very unostentatiously, but with great delight, during the greater part of his career.\n",
      "But even with the striking examples of Miss Currer and [273]Mrs. Rylands before us, the conclusion still forces itself upon one that the femme bibliophile is an all but unknown quantity.\n",
      "The New Woman may develop into a genuine book-lover; it is certain that the old one will not.\n",
      "Great was the assumed indignation of the Belgian bibliophile, who asserted that he had no books on him but those he had already accounted for.\n",
      "Here is another illustration, gleaned from the Greenwich Police Court: A person, forty-six, of ladylike appearance, and no occupation, was charged at Greenwich with stealing a book, valued 4d., from outside the shop of Charles Humphreys, 114, South Street.\n",
      "This can scarcely be described as book-stealing, for there is no proof that the 'book-lover' did not intend paying for the article ultimately.\n",
      "In all the books of a certain cunning bibliophile he had the price written in plain figures; when anyone asked him for the loan of a book he invariably replied, 'Yes, with pleasure,' and, looking in the volume, further added, 'I see the price of this work is £2 17s.\n",
      "'Swedenborg: Conjugal Love and its Opposite.'\n",
      "'Goldsmith lover' also seems a trifle confusing, until the lot is hunted up and the discovery made that Goldsmith's 'Works' is intended.\n",
      "The library is, as we have said, now the property of his son, Mr. Alfred H. Huth, who has made a number of important additions to it, and who is as ardent and as genuine a bibliophile as his father.\n",
      "Without approaching either in size or interest to that of Mr. Huth, the choice collection of books formed by Mr. Henry Hucks Gibbs, and lodged at his town-house at St. Dunstan's, Regent's Park, is full of attraction to the [302]student of English literature.\n",
      "The former has still a considerable number of important books, to which he is constantly adding; whilst his eldest son is worthily sustaining the reputation of the family for its love of rare and beautiful books.\n",
      "New Lodge, Windsor Forest, the residence of Colonel Victor Bates Van de Weyer, contains a collection of books of a unique character, collected at vast trouble and expense by his father, the late M. Sylvain Van de Weyer, one of the founders of the Belgian monarchy, and for many years Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.\n",
      "Mr. Andrew Lang is not only a distinguished bibliophile, but a prolific writer on the subject of books.\n",
      "Collectors love a clean book, but a book scrawled on may have other merits.\n",
      "Mr. Lang is the lucky owner of a copy of Stoddart's poem, 'The Death Wake' (1831), [311]that singular romantic or necromantic volume, which wise collectors will purchase when they can.\n",
      "Where the hero's love of arms and dread of death are mentioned, Aytoun has written 'A rum cove for a Hussar,' and he has added designs of skeletons and a sonnet to the 'wormy author.'\n",
      "There are, for example, Sainte-Beuve's 'Livre d'Amour,' which was suppressed after a few copies were struck off, with the author's own corrections; the Fortsas 'Catalogue,' the cruel joke of M. Renier Chalon; first editions of 'The English Spy,' an exceptionally fine copy; Coryat's 'Crambe, or, his Colwork,' 1611; Roger's 'Poems' and 'Italy'; a number of books [316]illustrated by Chodowiecki, the Cruikshank of Germany; practically all the books published by M. Octave Uzanne and Paul Lacroix in the finest possible states.\n",
      "M. John Gennadius, late Greek Minister at the Court of [321]St. James's, possessed one of the finest libraries formed during recent years.\n",
      "The library of Mr. W. Christie-Miller, of Britwell Court, Maidenhead, is understood to include many choice books, particularly early printed works, but no particulars of it are available.\n",
      "It is rather a collection formed by a statesman and a literary man than by a bibliophile; there are over 10,000 volumes, many of which are privately printed books, presentation copies; there is a large collection of historical works relating to Italy, Portugal, and France; Spanish literature, a memento of the taste of the third Lord Holland, is well represented; the collection of Elzevirs is very fine, as is also that of the Greek and Latin classics, and the highly curious collection of various copies of Charles James Fox's 'James II.,' which belonged to different celebrities, is housed here.\n",

      "'The Book-hunter in London' is the outcome not only of material which has been accumulating for many years past, from published and unpublished sources, but also of a long and pleasant intercourse with the leading book-collectors and booksellers in London, not to mention a vigorous and constant prosecution of one of the most pleasant and instructive of hobbies.\n",

      "If, early in the fifteenth century, the book-hunter in London possessed few opportunities of purchasing books, he would have found several very good libraries which were open to his inspection.\n",

      "The persons are not named, but the business was to cull out all superstitious books, as missals, legends, and such-like, and to deliver the garniture of the books, either gold or silver, to Sir Anthony Archer.\n",
      "There can be no doubt that several famous libraries have derived their origin from the mere vanity of emulating a fashionable pursuit.\n",
      "[34] Dr. Francis Bernard, chief physician to James II., was an indefatigable book-hunter; being 'a person who collected his books, not for ostentation or ornament, he seemed no more solicitous about their dress than his own, and, therefore, you'll find that a gilt back or a large margin was very seldom an inducement for him to buy.\n",
      "[39] Dr. David Williams, who from 1688 to the end of his life was minister of a Presbyterian congregation which met at Hand Alley, Bishopsgate Street, was a contemporary book-collector and book-hunter.\n",

      "The Duke turned book-hunter through a love affair, it is said.\n",
      "The Duke was a mighty hunter, not only of books, but of deer and wild swans.\n",
      "Here is another anecdote of a contemporary book-hunter: Nichols states that Mr. David Papillon (who died in 1762), a gentleman of fortune and literary taste, as well as a good antiquary, contracted with Osborne to furnish him with £100 worth of books, at 3d.\n",
      "Bindley, to whom John Nichols dedicated his 'Literary Anecdotes,' was a book-hunter who made very practical use of his scholarly tastes and ample means.\n",
      "Lamb's ideas of book-marking are to be found in his correspondence with Coleridge, in which he states that a book reads the better when the topography of its plots and notes is thoroughly mastered, and when we 'can trace the dirt in it, to having read it at tea with buttered muffins, or over a pipe.'\n",
      "Lamb, like Young, the poet, dog-eared his books to such an extent that many of them would hardly close at all.\n",
      "Devoid as Hill was of intellectual endowments, he managed to obtain and secure the friendship of many eminent men—of Thomas Campbell, the poet, Matthews and Liston, the comedians, Hook, Dubois, John and Leigh Hunt, James and Horace Smith, John Taylor, editor of the Sun, Horace Twiss, Baron Field, Sir George Rose, Barnes, subsequently editor of the Times, Cyrus Redding, and many others.\n",
      "The copy of the fourth edition of Byron's 'English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,' 1811, is that which was given by the author to Leigh Hunt, and contains the poet's autograph and many corrections; a presentation copy of Flatman's 'Poems and Songs,' 1682, to Izaak Walton, who has inscribed his autograph in it; Gay's copy of Horace; some proof-sheets of Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets;' a copy of Keats's 'Lamia,' 1820, with an autograph inscription and a sonnet 'On the Grasshopper and the Cricket,' also in the poet's handwriting; Gray's copy of Locke's 'Essay concerning Human Understanding,' a copy of the 'Dunciad,' 1729, with the inscription 'Jonath: Swift, 1729, amicissimi autoris donum'; and Isaac Newton's copy of Wheare's 'Method and Order of Reading Histories,' 1685.\n",

      "Dr. Harwood adds to his entry of this book: 'The finest copy of this first edition of Aristotle's works, perhaps in Europe, is in Dr. Hunter's Museum.'\n",

      "East, west, north, and south, there is, at all times and in all seasons, plenty of good hunting-ground for the sportsman, although the inveterate hunter will encounter a surfeit of Barmecides' feasts.\n",
      "Nearly every book-hunter has been more or less of a bookstaller, and the custom is more than tinctured with the odour of respectability by the fact that Roxburghe's famous Duke, Lord Macaulay the historian, and Mr. Gladstone the omnivorous, have been inveterate grubbers among the bookstalls.\n",
      "Leigh Hunt was a bookstaller, for he says: 'Nothing delights us more than to overhaul some dingy tome and read a chapter gratuitously.\n",
      "A copy of Sir Walter Scott's 'Vision of Don Roderick,' 1816, first edition, in the original boards, was purchased, by Mr. J. H. Slater, in Farringdon Road, in January, 1895, for 2d.—not a great catch, perhaps, but it is one of the rarest of Scott's works; and as the originals of this prolific author are rapidly rising in the market, there is no knowing what it may be worth in the immediate future.\n",
      "The book-hunter who goes to either of these places with the idea of bagging a whole bundle of rarities is likely to come away disappointed; but if he is in a buying humour the chances are ten to one in favour of his getting a good many useful books at very moderate figures.\n",
      "An East End book-hunter tells us that, among other rarities which he has rescued from stalls and cellars in that district, are a first folio Ben Jonson; a copy of the Froben Seneca (1515), with its fine bordered title-page, by Urs Graf; an early edition of Montaigne, with a curious frontispiece; the copy of the editio princeps Statius (1483), which was purchased by Mr. Quaritch at the Sunderland sale; one or two Plantins, in spotless splendour; Henry Stephens' Herodotus, a book as beautiful as it is now valueless, but of which a copy is kept in a showcase at South Kensington, and others, all at merely nominal prices.\n",
      "Now, Old Brown had a \"sixpenny box\" outside the door, and he had such a keen eye to business that I believe, if there was a box in London which would bear out Leigh Hunt's statement [that no one had ever found anything worth having in the sixpenny box at a bookstall], it was that box in Old Street.\n",
      "The tastes of the bookbuying public are so infinite that there would seem to be a sale, at some time or another, for every species of printed matter; but the habitual haunter of the bookstalls meets with the same water-soaked dog-eared volumes month after month, and year after year, so that he is forced to the conclusion that the right purchaser has not yet come along.\n",
      "However much one may denounce the whole system, it is impossible, whatever a particular book-hunter's idiosyncrasy may be, not to feel interested in some of the collections which these enterprising and ruthless biblioclasts manage to get together.\n",
      "It may be taken for granted that genuine Shakespeare quartos do not occur on bookstalls, and even a rare Americana tract only occurs in the wildest dreams of the book-hunter.\n",
      "It is the place where, according to a widely circulated statement, first made in Richardson's 'Remarks on Paradise Lost,' 1734, an Earl of Dorset accidentally discovered, when on a book-hunt in 1667, a work hitherto unknown to him, entitled 'Paradise Lost.'\n",
      "After the 'hunt' they often adjourned to the Mourning Bush in Aldersgate, where they dined and spent the remainder of the day.\n",
      "John Brand, secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, who died in 1806, visited almost daily the bookstalls between Piccadilly and Mile End, and may be regarded as another Moorfields book-hunter; he generally returned from these excursions with his deep and wide pockets well laden.\n",
      "He was a clergyman of that district, and, it is feared, sometimes neglected his religious duties for the more engrossing charms of the chase.\n",
      "The last firm of second-hand booksellers of note who thrived in Paternoster Row was that of William Baynes and Son; and the last of the race is still remembered by the older generation of book-collectors, with his old-time appearance in frills and gaiters.\n",
      "He was born at Liverpool in 1738, and after serving an apprenticeship with George Keith, Gracechurch Street, began business for himself on Fish Street Hill, which, being in the track of the medical students at the hospitals in the Borough, was a promising locality.\n",
      "W. Griffith was busy at the sign of the Falcon, near St. Dunstan's Church, printing booklets about current [217]events with 'flowery' titles, and these books he sold at his second shop, designated the Griffin, 'a little above the Conduit,' in Fleet Street.\n",
      "He had an especial aptitude at completing sets of particular authors—Landor, Leigh Hunt, Byron, Shelley—and contributed much to the prevailing taste for modern first editions.\n",
      "Reeves and Turner removed from Noble's old house in Chancery Lane, to the house on the west side of Temple Bar and adjoining it on the north, erected on the site of the famous old bulk-shop, the last of its race, where at one time Crockford, 'Shell-fishmonger and gambler,' lived.\n",
      "Every book-hunter of note has known, or knows, of its many shops.\n",
      "Thorpe was the first merchant in autographs, and Sir Thomas Phillipps was one of the first collectors who flourished in the iniquity of the pursuit, and it was the latter who on one occasion purchased the entire contents of one of Thorpe's autograph catalogues.\n",
      "When he first came to London, he worked as a printer at Watts', in Wild's Court, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he had the frame which had been occupied by Benjamin Franklin.\n"

      "The first Lord Lytton had a fancy for these plebeian book-marts; whilst Southey had a mania for them almost: he could not pass one without 'just running his eye over for one minute, even if the coach which was to take him to see Coleridge at Hampstead was within the time of starting.'\n",

      "But this subject has its popular graces also, and there is a sort of romantic interest attached to all that is associated with books-the rare old edition, the old printer, the blear-eyed collector, the binder, the sale, and the stray survivor of a whole edition, by some miracle preserved to our time.\n",
      "I do love you all !\n",

      "Lord Macaulay was peculiarly fond of rummaging the bookstalls, and scarcely a dusty old bookshop in any by-court or out- of- the-way corner in London escaped his attention.\n",
      "The bookworm, bibliophilist, or book fancier is a favourite and almost dramatic figure, with his dim eyes, rusty clothing, and eccentric affection for his treasures.\n",
      "We have a sympathetic tenderness for his lone, solitary ways, his self-denial and privations , his hungry ardour and prowlings after his \" midnight darlings. \"\n",
      "Here was the departure of a late book lover thus quaintly portrayed :-\" He had a quite human fondness for his books ; nothing annoyed him so much as to hear one 8 Book Collectors and Book Dealers.\n",
      "Yet I fancy the loyal heart would feel a twinge or scruple as he carries off from the humble and ignorant dealer, for a shilling or two, a volume that may be worth ten or twenty pounds.\n",
      "Dibdin says of this volume- If the lover of fine and legible printing wishes for a specimen of one of the choicest productions of the XV.\n",
      "A little volume might be written on these now famous books, and it must be confessed that there is a sort of flavour of romance attached to them.\n",

      "But apart from these solemn official treatises, there are some pleasantly garrulous little books, written with a light heart and out of pure love of the subject, and which offer very agreeable reading.\n",
      "Dr. Dibdin's treatises are well known and unique from their exaggerated raptures ; his earlier works are little known, such as the \" Literary Directory,\" or the \" Bibliographical Miscellany : an Essay on Bibliography and the Love of Books,\" issued 1806.\n",
      "A, 4 leaves, containing general title and preliminary matter ; B, 6 leaves, of which the first is the title to the Canterbury Tales ; C-T, V, X, Y, Z, in sixes ; AA, 6 leaves, of which the first is the title to the Romaunt of the Rose ; Bb-Pp, in sixes (of which Hhr is the title to Troylus and Creseide) ; Qq, 9 leaves ; Rr-Tt, in sixes (Ttr , the title of Boetius de Consolatione) ; Vv, Xx, Yy, Zz, in sixes ; Aaa to Vvv in sixes (of which Ddd 3 is a title, \"Howpite is ded, \" and Lllr the title of the Testament of Love).\n",
      "This spirited gentleman tells us that when he was a student at Yale College, from pure love of work and humanity, he prepared a MS. index to such periodicals as were in the library, which was so much used, and became so Signatures are now put at the bottom of the right- hand pages of sheets, and when the alphabet is finished a second begins Aa (instead of a single A) , and when that is terminated Aaa are given for the third , and so on.\n",
      "There is indeed an air of romance about many of these old coverings , and we gaze with curiosity and reverence at the elegant and decorated volumes which have come from the libraries of those light and airy ladies, Margaret of Valois or Diana of Poitiers.\n",
      "Monographs on celebrated pieces of binding are to be found scattered about, notably in the \" Bulletin de Bibliophile, \" and in catalogues such as that of the Libri Library.\n",
      "Amore interesting and brilliant collection was now to come.\n",
      "This sensible bibliophile, it is noted, never indulged in the usual exaggerated and unfounded encomiums of books, such as \"very rare,\" \"fine copy,\" \" believed to be unique. \"\n",
      "\"\" As a little indication of what collectors seek with avidity, we come on the following :-\" Thuanus, His First Marriage.\n",
      "A. Thuanus in gold on sides, and Monogram interlaced with that of Marie, his First Wife, in gold on back ; \" also, \" Thuanus, His Second Marriage.\n",
      "It has been humorously remarked that the indorsements at the back ofbooks do not always intimate what is to follow, for neitherthe \" Novella of Leo, \" or the \" Extravagantés, \" as edited by Godefroi, contain matter of a light, airy, or amusing kind.\n",
      "A French bibliophile, M. Peignet, has actually published a work supplying a list of these fantastic productions.\n",
      "The author, M. de Rochas, contends that a love-poem printed with light ink on rose-coloured paper will make a far deeper impression than if printed in black ink on white paper.\n",
      "In the Exhibition of 1862 was shown a sort of typographical tour de force by one of M. Dupont's compositors a statue of Gutenberg, a portrait of Beranger, and Cupid and Psyche (an odd company), all set up in \" leads, \" and at a proper distance looking exactly like engravings.\n",
      "The problem has, nevertheless, always had a sort of attraction for printers, both in England and in other countries, and has been attempted frequently.\n",
      "The parchment pages, every one as big as the lease of the Castle of Otranto or Mrs. Shandy's marriage settlement, have the staves ruled blood- red, and on them rest, or rather ride , the notes.\n",
      "Never was there such a foolish craze founded on pure curiosity, and it may be suspected, without breach ofcharity, from no burning ardour to be in possession of the purest and most genuine version of the sacred text.\n",
      "Returning to other \" oddities, \" the old halfpenny ballads have always had an attraction for the collector, and Macaulay's taste in this direction is well known.\n",
      "No doubt the attraction is what the French call \" scatological \" or \" Pantagruelic. \"\n",

      "It will be a surprise to know that even in the present time there is sometimes a wealthy amateur who, with a love or passion for a particular subject, determines to adorn it in a special fashion, and gives an order for a superb memorial to be prepared, set off with exquisite writing, a series of drawings and watercolours, the whole being bound with all the luxury \"the bibliopegistic art \" can furnish .\n",
      "It is thus that we find many a superb volume prepared, to celebrate this generous ardour.\n",
      "It formerly belonged to Mr. Hanrott, the eminent bibliophile, and after his death was purchased for £173, 5s.\n",
      "The way these are combined with the type, the romance and sympathy in the touches, the beauty and dreamy character of the whole, make these most charming little works, and quite account for the general desire to possess them.\n",
      "Some industrious ones have traced his very earliest productions, carried by their ardour Among the “ ana ” is a curious little book on the “ Origin of Sam Weller, \" published by Mr. Jarvis, and which certainly supports its title in showing how Sam was suggested, It seems that there was an actor of the name of Sam Vale playing at the Olympic some sixty years since .\n",

      "What the French bibliographer says is undoubtedly true, but curiously enough, he misses the crux of the situation, for as we have already mentioned, no book can be regarded as really \" scarce,\" from the bibliophile's point of view, if there is no demand for it.\n",
      "There are, as is well known, many collectors who love to work out the history of some important volume from the present to the past, to follow it in its wanderings from one library to another, to ascertain the cir- cumstances under which it was written and given to the world, in fact, to discover as much about it, and the man who wrote it, as possible, and to trace its ownership back, step by step, to the time whenit left the hands of the printer.\n",
      "These differences of opinion have not been advanced and insisted upon for the mere love of disputation, as might perhaps be supposed.\n",
      "It is occasionally a neces- sary part of the knowledge which the book-lover must possess himself of if he would keep himself abreast of the times.\n",
      "Sincethen the taste has become more and more refined till the specialist has usurped the place formerlyheld by the general lover.\n",
      "The whole subject involves an intimate knowledge of type founding or casting, and opens up a profitless inquiry.\n",
      "The third edition by Jarvis, of \" Don Quixote,\" 2 vols., 4to, with its 68 plates by Vander Gucht, the edition of Horace by John Pine, 2 vols., royal 8vo, 1733-7, remarkable for the beauty of its illustrations, especially in the first issue, which can be easily told by the mistake (\" Post est\" for \" Potest\"), on the medal of Caesar at page 108, vol.\n",
      "There are collectors of bindings, just as there are of books, and every collector likes to have, and endeavours to procure, books in their original, or failing that, contemporary covers; or, better than all, except in a very few cases, in bindings having about them something of the glamour of history or romance.\n",
      "They were ancient manuscripts, important in themselves no doubt, though the attraction really centred in the bindings of silver gilt ornamented with pearls, precious stones, and enamels.\n",
      "One of the books usually consulted whenever it is wished to trace armorials of this kind is Guigard's \"Armorial du Bibliophile,\" published in 1870.\n",
      "It is written in so simple and natural a manner that the reader cannot help feeling that the heart of the writer was in his work, and that books may on occasion possess a special charm by reason of their having belonged to illustrious persons or to celebrated collectors of the past.\n",
      "The far-off contact with the hands of people whose names yet live in the annals of history or romance still clings to many a book that perhaps would otherwise be of no account.\n",
      "Collectors appreciate such volumes, and cherish them with especial care by reason of their associations.\n",
      "The same spirit exists now as always, as witness M. Janin's \" L' Amour des Livres,\" published in Paris so recently as 1866.\n",
      "He had a complete collection of Aldines, many of them in covers designed by Geoffrey Tory, who was also a book lover, others by Aldus himself, and others again by Italian binders, whose names are unknown.\n",
      "Longepierre, who stamped his covers with a golden fleece, is as well known as, but perhaps, on the whole, more highly esteemed than Guilbert de Pixer^court, the book-lover and playwright, who founded the Societe des Bibliophiles Fran9ais.\n",
      "Elizabeth was a great lover of books, and frequently employed her needle to embroider the covers.\n",
      "Hollis died in 1774, and it is curious that from that time the love of books in England seemed to wane, till Dibdin and the Roxburghe sale spurred it into full vigour once more.\n"

      "Those days have, however, almost gone, and although no book-lover worthy of the namebuys a book simply because he thinks it cheap at the price, and hopes to make a profit upon it in the future, he is compelled, in most cases at any rate, to adapt himself to the circumstances in which he is placed and to do as others do.\n",
      "But the book-lover to whom money is of some account, and who regards literature as the primary object of his desires, must make up his mind to do without such rarities as the quartos of Elizabethan dramatists, and to read what they have written in another and more modern form.\n",

      "His, however, was an exceptional gift, and though the individual history of a book is often of the greatest possible importance, most 12 HINTS TO BEGINNERS collectors prefer to persuade themselves that it is impracticable to learn anything about it, rather than spend an immense amount of time on what may, after all, prove a fruitless quest.\n",

      "To pursue the subject we find the first book printed in South Africa to be G. F. Grand's \" Narrative of the Life of a Gentleman long resident in India,\" Cape of Good Hope, 1814, 4to; and the first book printed at Quebec, a Prayer Book and Catechism compiled by J.\n",

      "The England of the twelfth century is described as being a paradise of scholars, but the first English book-hunter of eminence seems to have been the Richard de Bury, of whom wehave spoken on several occasions.\n",
      "The catalogue of this first sale of books ever held by auction in this 1 66 AUCTION SALES country is extant, and the prices of the books realized then, when contrasted with what would be obtained for them now, are calculated to make the enthusiastic book-hunter wish he could set back the clock so as to be able to secure, for example, Eliot's Indian Bible for iqs., and the Editio Princeps of Homer for 8s., to say nothing of numerous American books and tracts, now worth more than their weight in gold, for the price of an old song.\n",
      "To pay too muchfor what, after all, is but a temporary possession, and to leave those who follow us in the race of life the worse off for our indifference or negligence, has come to be regarded as an exhibition of selfishness, far outweighing that \" gentility of tradition \" which was at one time the guiding principle in matters of the kind.\n",

      "My love for book-collecting and my love for London have gone hand in hand.\n",
      "From the first, London with its wealth of literary and historic interest has held me; there has never been a time, not even on that gloomy December day twenty years ago, when, with injuries subsequently diagnosed as a \"compound comminuted tibia and fibula,\" I was picked out of an overturned cab and taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital for repairs, that I could not say with Boswell, \"There is a city called London for which I have as violent an affection as the most romantic lover ever had for his mistress.\"\n",
      "I cannot say that \"I was 'broke' in London in the fall of '89,\" for the simple reason that I was not in London that year; but I am never long in London without finding myself as light in heart and pocket as Eugene Field--the result of yielding to the same temptations.\n",
      "[2] A few years later I was offered a presentation copy of the work, with an inscription to Keats's intimate friends, Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke, for a thousand dollars, and while I was doing some preliminary financing the book disappeared, and forever; and I have never ceased regretting that the dedication copy of Boswell's \"Life of Johnson,\" to Sir Joshua Reynolds, passed into the collection of my lamented friend, Harry Widener, rather than into my own.\n",
      "Remember too that Keats's poem,-- Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong, And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song,-- was addressed to my great-great-uncle, George Felton Mathew; and let me refer to the fact that on my first visit to England I had spent several days with his sister, who as a young girl had known Keats well, and it will be realized that the possession of this treasure made my heart thump.\n",
      "One of the pleasantest things which has happened to us here is the coming down on us of the Laureate, who, being in London for three or four days from the Isle of Wight, spent two of them with us, dined with us, smoked with us, opened his heart to us (and the second bottle of port), and ended by reading \"Maud\" through from end to end, and going away at half-past two in the morning.\n",

      "It is a difficult lot to classify, and not of overwhelming interest; not to be compared with the Richard Waln Meirs collection of Cruikshank, which has just been bequeathed to the Library; but nothing which is a book is entirely alien to me, and the Hutton books, with their inscriptions from their authors, testifying to their regard for him and to his love of books, are well worth examination.\n",
      "I did not ask the librarian, for he might have referred the question to the trustees, or something; but I did turn to a speaking likeness of \"Larry\" that hung right over the bookcase and seemed to say, \"Why, sure, fellow book-lover; pass on the torch, print anything you please.\"\n",

      "Caxtons and incunabula of any sort are highly regarded; even the possession of a set of the Shakespeare folios makes a man a marked man, in spite of the fact that Henrietta Bartlett says they are not rare; but then, Miss Bartlett has been browsing on books rarer still, namely, the first quartos, of which there are of \"Hamlet\" two copies only, one in this country with a title-page, but lacking the last leaf, while the other copy, in the British Museum, has the last leaf but lacks the title-page; and \"Venus and Adonis,\" of the first eight editions of which only thirteen copies are known to exist.\n",

      "Miss Kelly's rejection of an offer of marriage from him must be a figment of the imagination of an old lady, who, as her years approached a century, had her dream-children, too--children who called Lamb father.\n",

      "With such marrying blood in her veins it is easily understood that, as soon as Thrale's halter was off her neck,--this sporting phrase, I regret to say, is Dr. Johnson's,--she should think of marrying again; and that having the first time married to please her family, she should, at the second venture, marry to please herself.\n",
      "Her _dot_ was provided by the uncle; her mother did the courting, with little opposition on the part of the lady and no enthusiasm on the part of the suitor.\n",

      "Constantly in that condition in which ladies wish to be who love their lords, Mrs. Thrale, by her advice and efforts, once, at least, saved her husband from bankruptcy, and frequently from making a fool of himself.\n",
      "She grew to take an intelligent interest in his business affairs, urged him to enter Parliament, successfully electioneered for him, and in return was treated with just that degree of affection that a man might show to an incubator which, although somewhat erratic in its operations, might at any time present him with a son.\n",
      "Retaining his lodgings in a court off Fleet Street, he established in them what Mrs. Thrale called his menagerie of old women: dependents too poor and wretched to find asylum elsewhere.\n",

      "By the bargain she had purchased peace, and, as she said, \"restoration to her original rank in life\"; recording in her journal, \"Now that it is all over I'll go to church and give God thanks and forget the frauds, follies and inconveniences of commercial life; as for Dr. Johnson, his honest heart was cured of its incipient passion for trade by letting him into _some_ and _only some_ of its mysteries.\"\n",

      "The fact that he was a Catholic, an Italian, and a musician could hardly have appeared to him as reasons why he should not court a woman of rare charm and distinction, with whom he had been on terms of friendship for several years; a woman who was of suitable age, the mistress of a fine estate and three thousand pounds a year, and whose children were no longer children but young ladies of independent fortune.\n",
      "That she should marry some one seemed certain.\n",
      "Dr. Johnson was once more to make his lodgings in Bolt Court, and Mrs. Thrale, after a visit to Brighton, was to go to Bath to repose her purse.\n",

      "In it he says, \"I am in full sympathy with Mrs. Thrale under the painful opposition to her marriage with Piozzi.\n",
      "The single excuse for Johnson's letter to her on that occasion would be that he was her lover himself, and hoped to win her, otherwise it was simply brutal.\"\n",
      "I do not think that Johnson was her lover, and I am afraid I must agree that Johnson was brutal.\n",
      "Two dates were given as to the time of her marriage, which started some wandering lies, much to her disadvantage.\n",
      "No marriage could have been happier.\n",

      "Their preparation for the press was somewhat crude: it consisted largely in making omissions here and there, and substituting asterisks for proper names; but the copyright was sold for five hundred pounds, and the letters showed, if indeed it was necessary to show, how intimate had been the relationship between the Doctor and herself.\n",
      "She had lost caste by her marriage.\n",
      "Dr. Johnson also kept a diary on this journey, but his is bald and fragmentary, while that of the lady is an intimate and consecutive narrative.\n",
