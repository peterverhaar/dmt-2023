      <h2>Letter from De Erven F. Bohn to W. Blackwood and sons, January 22nd, 1873</h2>
      <p>Dear Sirs!</p>
      <p>
         Dear Sirs!
         We beg to apply to you the kind request for sending us one week before the publication
         one copy of Bulwer's novel: Kenelm Chillingly, His adventures and
         opinions, which book you have in the press, for what we are inclined to pay
         30 Â£. When it were possible to send us already now the first volume by the post; it
         would
         be yet more agreeable. Mr H.A. Kramers at Rotterdam readily will be our pledge.
         your truly
         De Erven F. Bohn
         
      </p>
      <p> your truly</p>
