<h2> Get to know me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Nina de Rijk, I am 23 years old and I was born and raised on a little island at the bottom of South Holland, called Goeree Overflakkee. After living here for most of my life, I moved to Tilburg for a little bit, and am currently residing in Rotterdam. This is also where I plan to stay for the foreseeable future.</p>
    
<h3> Academic Background</h3>
    <p> After receiving my HAVO diploma in the direction of culture and society, little 17 year old me moved to Tilburg to study <a href= "https://www.fontys.nl/Studeren/Opleidingen/Trend-Research-Concept-Creation-in-Lifestyle.htm">Trend Research and Concept Creation in Lifestyle</a> at Fontys Academy for the Creative Economy.
    I did not enjoy this at all, so after receiving my Propedeuse, I quit the program and moved back home. <br>
        Then in 2019 I started the bachelor Algemene Cultuurwetenschappen at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, also known as <a href= "https://www.eur.nl/bachelor/international-bachelor-arts-and-culture-studies">International Bachelor of Arts and Culture Studies.</a> <br>
        During this bachelor program, I did a semester abroad at the University of Leeds. During this semester, I followed three courses at the <a href= "https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/english"> School of English</a> I enjoyed this immensely, and loved living abroad.</p>

<h3>Professional Background</h3>
    <p> As for my professional background, I have a lot of experience in the hospitality branche. I have worked in different types of restaurants since I was 15 years old. Within this branche, I have progressed from doing the dishes, to serving food, to being a barista, which I have stuck with. I now work as a barista in a juice bar & cafe called Sajoer in Rotterdam.</p>
    
<h3>My hobbies</h3>
    <p>As for my hobbies, there are a couple of things that I love to do in my spare time, which are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading: I love to sit on my couch, with a blanket, a cup of tea, and a good book.</li>
        <li>Coffee: I love everything coffee, from making cute cappuccino's to drinking cute cappuccino's.</li>
        <li>Food: I love everything food as well, I mostly enjoy discovering hotspots and eating the best food. I also rather enjoy cooking, but would not call myself a good cook. ;) </li>
        <li>Sports: I have my non-active phases, but currently I am enjoying playing squash or tennis!</li>
        <li>Traveling: I like to travel and discover new things and places (especially the food), although I have sadly never been outside of Europe.</li>
    </ul>
