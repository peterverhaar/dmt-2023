	Dear Mr. Forster:
		Mr. Brace landed in Naples last Tuesday and plans
	to arrive in London at the end of the month. I know he looks for-
	ward to seeing you. I have your favor of March 27th and the com-
	plete corrected proofs of "Mrs. Fay". I have spent and enjoyable
	hour looking through them -- it is an engaging book.

		I have personally impressed upon our manufacturing
	department all that you say about the necessity of following copy
	exactly, and I have given them and had then send /illegible, possibly [tu]/ our printers a
	copy of that part of your letter referring to the matter. About
	sending you proofs: How that I have looked at the book, I see that
	it is just the /illegible, possibly [wort api]/ to be freely imported in the British edition.
	I am, therefore, inclined to publish it as nearly simultaneously
	with The Hogarth Press as it is possible for us to do so. You will,
	of course, be careful to have The Hogarth Press send us two copies
	of the British edition as soon as they are available, in order that
	we may take out ad interim copyright. Will you also send us their
	date of publication as soon /illegible, probably [as]/ it is settled? Perhaps it would be
	wise to cable this date. If it is late enough so that we can send
	you proofs, we shall be glad to do so. If there is not time, I do
	not feel that we ought to run the risk of leakage -- our uulesman /probably [salesmen]/,
	who are visiting the bookstores all the time, estimate that at least
	three thousand copies of the British edition of "A Passage to India"
	found their way to the American market.

		We will proceed to put "Mrs. Fay" into type as
	promptly as possible.

			Sincerely yours,
