        <h2>Letter from De Erven F. Bohn to W. Blackwood and sons </h2>
       
        
        <p>Dear Sirs!</p>
        <p>We beg to apply to you the kind request for sending us one week before the publication one copy 
            of Bulwer's novel: Kenelm Chillingly, His adventures and opinions, which book you have in the press,
            for what we are inclined to pay 30Â£. When it were possible to send us already now the first volume
            by the post; it would be yet more agreeable. Mr H.A. Kramers at Rotterdam readily will be our pledge.</p>
       
        
        <p>yours truly</p>
