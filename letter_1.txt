Dear Madam,

	Thank you for your letter of March 30 regarding The Psycho-Analytical Reader and The Captain's Death Bed. We regret that the American rights are not available in either of these books. The Psycho-Analytical Reader is already published in America by the International Universities Press and, if you will refer to my letter of December 7, you will see that I have already explained that all Virginia Woolf's books are published in the States by Harcourt Brace & Co.

               Yours faithfully,

               for the Hogarth Press Ltd. 

Miss S.A. Branower,
15 East Fortieth Street,
New York 16, N.Y.
