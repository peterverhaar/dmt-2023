Dear Miss Belsher,
Would you be so kind as to let me know
the dates on which the amounts making up
advance royalties of £800 on All Passion Spent
were paid. I have only got two ammounts,
viz. £300 in May and £300 in November, and as
Mrs. Nicolson is away from Long Barn I have
no means of finding out, except through you,
and I must know for Income Tax returns. I am
so sorry to worry you.
Yours sincerely,
Audrey Heffill
Secretary.

Dear Mr. Woolf,

I am so sorry that a rough draft of
our agreement pencilled in by me was sent you by
mistake instead of the typed out and tidy copy
you ought to have received.

Certainly, we agree that you have
Canada. The Canadian market is of very little
value in any case, and we only like to have it,
where it is not already allocated, because
certain large orders from big retailers who have
branches both in Canada and the United States,
sometimes present a difficulty, otherwise. I
quite agree also with your phrasing of the matter
of the option on ON PROVIDENCE is better than
mine. I am having the alteration made and will
send the agreement through to you within a few
days.

Yours sincerely,
Alfredgak
HM. My writing, like my letter, was hardly
grammar!
