<h1> My name is Korina Lemonidou </h1>
<h2> Here are some things about me! </h2>
<p> I am 22 years old and I am Greek. I completed my bachelor's degree on English Language and Literature at the <a href="https://www.auth.gr/en/"> Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</a> which is located in Greece. Some of my interests include reading, going out with friends and also traveling whenever I have the chance! I would say my favourite book genres are fiction and essays but I also love a good autobiography! If I had to choose a favourite book it would be "The Year of Magical Thinking" by Joan Didion (although it is extremely heart-wrenching and I would probably never read it again).</p>

<h2> I also love learning foreign languages! Currently I speak:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Greek</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>a bit of Russian</li>
</p>
</ul>

<td style="width:20%">Prior Knowledge</td> 
<td>I would say that my technical skills are on a very basic level at this point. They mostly include Microsoft Office and a basic knowledge of translation tools such as Wordfast and Matecat.</td>

<tr>
<td>Expectations</td> 
<td>Through this course I am excited to learn about the various ways in which technology can enhance the world of the Book and how I can design digital content myself.</td>
