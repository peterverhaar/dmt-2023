                       The Common Reader First and Second Series
Dear Sirs, 

	In reply to your letter of April 12th and further to our conversation on the telephone with Mr. Parley of your London office, we now find unfortunately that it is not possible for us to get the balance of paper needed for the above books to you in time for you to keep your delivery date of May 15th. We must therefore ask you to be good enough to reduce the run from 3000 copies to 1800 copies of each Series, using the paper which you already have, and we shall supply you with enough paper later to make a second impression, quantity to be decided later. 

Will you please therefore print 1200 copies of each Series for H.M. Stationery Office order with special imprint according to the instructions already given you, and 600 or balance printing to paper of each Series for our own Uniform Edition.
We trust we shall be receiving pulls of the prelims from you very shortly. 
                                        Yours faithfully
                                             for the Hogarth Press   BH
