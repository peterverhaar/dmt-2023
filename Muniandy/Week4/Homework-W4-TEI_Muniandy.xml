                    <salute>Dear Mrs. Woolf</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>
                Thank you for your letter of <date>June 30th</date> enclosing the<lb/> 
                signed copy of the agreement for <title>A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN </title>. I am<lb/>
                quite willing to have you retain the <placeName>Canadian</placeName> rights if you wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                In regard to serialization, I had been doing nothing<lb/> 
                because I thought it was your wish to abandon the idea. In<lb/>
                <persName>Mr. Woolf's</persName> letter on <date>May 16th</date>, he said: "We will not trouble about<lb/>
                about serialization, but go straight ahead with publication in<lb/>
                book form." And besides, the manuscript has been in <persName>Mr.<lb/>
                Well's</persName> hands. I got the manuscript back from him yesterday,</lb>
                and have delivered it to <emph rend ="underlined">The Bookman</emph>. I ams sorry if I have<lb/>
                misinterpreted your wishes, but no doubt there is still time<lb/>
                as far as <emph rend ="underlined">The Bookman</emph> is concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                Meanwhile, just after I received your letter, <persName>Curtis<lb/> 
                Brown's</persName> office telephoned to ask if they could get the manuscript,<lb/>
                saying that they had a message from you to get in touch with<lb/>
                us about it. I believe <emph rend ="underlined">The Bookman</emph> had already been asking<lb/>
                <persName>Curtis Brown</persName>. If I get further inquiries from <persName>Curtis Brown</persName>,<lb/> 
                I shall tell them that we are dealing with the matter by your<lb/>
                instructions. Of course, if it appears that the business ought<lb/>
                to go through <persName>Curtis Brown</persName> and the ought to have a commission,<lb/>
                we would be glad to stand aside as far as any commission is<lb/>
                concerned and continue to do what we can dispose of the<lb/>
                rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                <persName>Mr. Wells</persName> tells me that he has made you an offer in<lb/>
                respect to a limited edition. If there is to be a limited<lb/>
                edition, we shall gladly co-operate with <persName>Mr. Wells</persName> and with<lb/>
                you in regard to arranging dates of publication and protection<lb/>
                of copyright. I hope it maybe possible for you to send<lb/>
                soon finally corrected proofs, especially if there is to be a<lb/>
                limited edition. If you could arrange to send duplicate final<lb/>
                proofs so that <persName>Mr. Wells</persName> could have one set and we could have<lb/>
                the other, matters would be greatly expedited.
                </p>
                <pb/>
                <p>
                There is one thing about the limited edition matter<lb/>
                which I think I ought to mention, though I do so with some<lb/>
                hesitation. When I recommend the publication of a limited<lb/> 
                edition of ORLANDO by <persName>Mr. Gaige</persName>, my recommendation was<lb/>
                based on long knowledge of him and completed certainty of his<lb/>
                reliability. As for his successors, I have not the same<lb/>
                knowledge or the same certainty, and I should have hesitated<lb/>
                to make similar recommendation. Of course, you are dealing<lb/>
                with <unclear>Messrs</unclear>. <persName>Wells</persName> and <persName>Adams</persName> direct, and it is probably all<lb/>
                right for your to take whatever risk is involved. It is<lb/>
                simply that I really know next to nothing about them, and that<lb/>
                in succeeding <persName>Mr. Gaige</persName>, they do not succeed to the complete<lb/>
                confidence I have in him. Please don't take this any more<lb/>
                seriously than if it is intended.
                </p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>
                        With kindest regards to yourself and <persName>Mr. Woolf</persNamenmb>,<lb/>
                        Yours sincerely,
                    </salute>
                    <signed/>Donald C. Brace.
