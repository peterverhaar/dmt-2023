    Modernism made an impact early in the 20th century century. Artists such as the Frenchman Henri Matisse, the Norwegian Edvard Munch (whose 1893
    <title>Scream<genre>paintings</genre></title>
    summed up modern urban alienation) and the
    <title></title>Austrian Oskar Kokoschka used vivid colours and broad brushstrokes to express mood and emotion, and the personal feelings evoked by a situation rather than the way it literally looked. Much avant-garde modernist culture - books such as James Joyce's
    <title>Ulysses<genre>novels</genre></title>, poems such as T. S. Eliot's
    <title>The Waste Land<genre>poems</genre></title>
    and Ezra Pound's
    <title>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley<genre>poems</genre></title>, modern art, modern architecture, ballets staged by Sergei Diaghilev - was, for most of the first half of the 20th century, only enjoyed by small groups of intellectuals. The public reacted with jeers and contempt to Stravinsky's
    <title>The Rite of Spring<genre>plays</genre></title>, and D.H. Lawrence's
    <title>
      Lady Chatterley's Lover<genre>novels</genre></title>
    has been banned in the UK for several decades. Whereas Pirandello's
    <title>Six Characters in Search of an Author<genre>plays</genre></title>
    and Ionesco's
    <title>Rhinoceros<genre>plays</genre></title>
    shaped the face of modernism in the theatre, their first stagings attracted extremely hostile public reactions.
