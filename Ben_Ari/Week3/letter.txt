Dear William,

I have just received a cable from Messers. Simon and Schuster as follows - “unintelligable Sado if unintelligable America”.
Of course I don’t know what you your are doing about the American rights - would you let me know what I am to reply?

Dear Miss Hepworth

We have your letter regarding the request from the House of Books, New York for ten copies of your addition of Woolf: A HAUNTED HOUSE, in which you say you assume that we will have no objection to supplying the small order. Naturally, we would not wish to make any difficulty about so small a matter, though it is true, that if similar instances were to be numerous, we should have to object to your supplying in competition with us in the American market. As you know, we have always consented to your sending over a prepublication supply of each of blank box, out of consideration for the legitimate demand for the English first edition.

However, there is a rather different point involved in the case of supplying the English edition, after the book has been copyrighted in this country. Under the copyright law, the importation of copies of the copyrighted work for sale is illegal, and the Customs authorities are required to refuse entry. As a matter of fact, the authorities are not completely official about this, and copies to sleep through. The Lord is not pregnant, even publisher that is, the owner of the copyright – to import. We think you should bear does aspect of the problem in mine in dealing with orders you may receive her books that are copyrighted here.

You’re sincerely, 
Harcourt, Brace and Company,

Donald Brace.
