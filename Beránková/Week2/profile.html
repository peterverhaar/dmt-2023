            Hi everyone, nice to digitally meet you! My name is Frantiska (she/her), I am 23 years old and I come from Czech Republic.
            I completed my Bachelor's degree in English Language and Culture at the <a href=https://www.uva.nl/en>University of Amsterdam</a>, including an Erasmus year abroad at the <a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/>University of Edinburgh</a> which I have just returned from.

        <p>
            Recently, I have been reading a lot of non-fiction (which my childhood self would be so disappointed by)!
            I am most interested in travel/mountaineer literature, and some of my favourites include <i>Into The Wild</i> by Jon Krakauer, <i>The Living Mountain</i> by Nan Shepherd, and <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> by John Muir.
            Other than that, I love some good sci-fi, most notably <i>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</i> by Becky Chambers. This is also reflected in my favourite film of all time being <i>Interstellar</i> (2014). If any of this catches your eye, please feel free to come up and chat about it!:)
        </p>
        <h4>
            The languages that I speak are:
        </h4>
        <p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Czech - native</li> 
            <li>English - fluent</li>
            <li>Dutch - working knowledge haha</li>
        </ul> 
        (I also did a bit of Spanish in high school, but that really cannot count. And by speaking Czech, I also understand quite a bit of any Slavic language!)
