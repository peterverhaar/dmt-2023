Dear Sir,
I Thank you for your letter of the
1st ___ and would confirm that I
would like you to publish the book for
me on the terms which you suggest:
I take it therefore that you will
now prepare a formal contract which I
shall be glad to receive at your convenience.
I also thank you for your specimen tape (?)
which appears to me to be satisfactory,
and which I now return.
I suggest as a title for the book
"Smoke Rings"
Yours faithfully,
Coralie Hobson
