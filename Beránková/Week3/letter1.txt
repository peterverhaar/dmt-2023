Dear sirs,

Thank you for your letter of May
13. Unfortunately, the press cuttings
for Death of My Aunt and Streamers
Waving do not seem to be in the office,
and I can only assume that they were
lost either in the blitz or in the
various moves of the Press. I am sorry
as we should, of course, have been
pleased to lend them to you.

Yours truly,

for The Hogarth Press Ltd.
