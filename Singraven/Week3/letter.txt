Dear Sir:

After receiving your letter of December eighth and the copy of Thompson’s “The Other Side of the Medal”, we cabled you as follows : 

“Accept your terms Other Side Medal. Please advise your publication date and send two copies for interim copyright.”

We now enclose formal agreements in duplicate, both copies having been signed by us. If you find these in order, please return one copy with your signature for our records. The agreements are in conformity with previous agreements between you and us, except that Clause V is a somewhat simpler form of the reversion clause. We do not know whether you wish us to have Canada or not. It is included in the agreement, but if you wish to reserve
this market, we would not object, and you can simply cross out the words “and Canada”. 

Apparently, the date of your publication is sufficiently recent to enable us to deposit copies in Washington within sixty days after your date and protect the copyright. It is for that reason that we asked you in our cable to let us have your date and to send us two more copies for copyright purposes.

Although the subject matter may seem remote for this country, the book is written with so much fervor that we found ourselves greatly interested in it, and I hope we shall do well with it. 

Faithfully yours
Harcourt, Brace and Company
