
TRANSCRIPT 1 - LETTER FROM ALINE BUTCH TO BOW LIBRARY (22.11.1954)

AB 22nd November, 1954.

Dear Sir,

	Thank you for your letter of February 
18. I'm afraid that we cannot help you 
with regard to a copy of KEW GARDENS as 
we have only our file copy. Presumably 
your friend is anxious to possess the original edition as if he wants to read 
the story, it is, of course, included 
in A HAUNTED HOUSE. 

	I am so sorry not to be able to 
help you. 

		Yours faithfully,
		
		for the Hogarth Press Ltd. 


James Kearsley, Esq., 
Bow Library, 
564 Roman Road, 
Bow, E. 3.

TRANSCRIPT 2 - LETTER FROM LEONARD WOOLF TO ERNEST JONES (23.03.1947)


LS-AB 13th March, 1947.

Dr. Ernest James,
The Flat, Elstad, 
MR. Midburst, 
Sussex. 

Dear Dr. James, 

	I have had a letter from 'Vision' asking permission to 
reprint an extract from your 'Essays in Applied Psychology'. 
This book is, of course, in The Psycho-analytical Library and 
it is among those the rights of which we bought for a sum down 
in 1924. It is out of print at the moment but I think it very 
important that eventually we should be able to reprint it for 
the Library. 

	I presume that all they wish to publish is an extract, 
namely the study of Hamlet. I should be prepared to allow them 
to do this provided that the number of copies in the edition 
was limited and that they paid a nominal fee of, say, Fifteen 
Guiness. I am therefore writing to them in this sense.

Yours sincerely, 

Dictated but not signed 
by Mr. Woolf.
