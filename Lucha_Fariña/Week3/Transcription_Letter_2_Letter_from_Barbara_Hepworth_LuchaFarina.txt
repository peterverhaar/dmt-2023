Dear Madam, 
		In reply to your card of June 29th, we are enclosing a review copy of Three Guineas. We shall be interested to see your quarterly review with the notice when It appears. 
		As you will see, in Three Guineas Mrs. Woolf concerns herself with the present status of women, and with the urgent question What Does A Women Do To Prevent War? Like A ROOM OF ONE’s OWN, Three Guineas in essential reading for any women with an interest in present day affairs, and who has not?
		We are having a number of cards printed to bring this book to the attention of an even wider audience than it has already obtained, and I am wondering weather you would be willing either to send it out to your members, possibly with material of your own, or if you would provide us with a list to whom we could dispatch.
		The book was the subject of a lander in a recent issue of The Time Literary Supplement, in which Mrs. Woolf was described as the most brilliant pamphleteer in England, and it was furthermore suggested that “this brilliant and searching pamphlet might mark an epoch in the world’s history.” Let us hope that this may be so!
					Yours very truly, 


						Manager.
