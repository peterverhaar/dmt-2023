AL.							30th April 1952

Dear Mr. Nicholas,
	Thank you for your letter of April 29th and for returning the agreement between The Hogarth Press and the late Mrs. Woolf for Orlando. 
	We are still trying to find out the exact date of publication of Orlando in this country, but an it will probably mean a visit to the British Museum you will understand that it may be a few days before we can let you have this information. 
							Your sincerely,
