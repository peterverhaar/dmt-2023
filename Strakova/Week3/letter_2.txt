Dear Sir
	I Thank you for your letter of the
1st mrt. and could confirm that I
would like you to publish the book for
me on the terms which you suggest.
	I take it therefore that you will
now prepare a formal contract which I
shall be glad to receive at your convenience.
	I also thank you for your speciman page
which appears to me to be satisfactory,
and which I now return.
	I suggest as a title for the book
"Smoke Rings"
		Yours faithfully
