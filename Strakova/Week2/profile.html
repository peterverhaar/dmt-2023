    Hi everyone! I'm Alma and I'm 23 years old. I'm from Latvia, 
    but I've lived in the Netherlands for about 4 years now.
</p>



<h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I like to read (here is my <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/almareads123">Storygraph</a> account), as well as watch films. 
            <p>Some books I've read recently are:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Death or Ice Cream </i>by Gareth P. Jones</li>
                    <li><i>Convenience Store Woman </i>by Sayaka Murata</li>
                    <li><i>Neverwhere</i> by Neil Gaiman</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>Some of the films I've seen (and enjoyed) recently are:
            <ul>
                <li><i>The Batman (2022)</i></li>
                <li><i>Legally Blonde (2001)</i></li>
                <li><i>Barbie (2023)</i></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I also love talking about languages, media, art, and anything else, really. :)
            </p>

    <h3>Work and studies</h3>
        <p>
            Before starting this master's programme, I studied English Language and Culture at Leiden University.
            I also worked at the university as a research assistant on the project “Language of the Poor in Late Modern Scotland”.
            (If you're interested, <a href="https://scotpp.lucdh.nl/">here</a> is the project website). I've also worked as a student mentor.
        </p>
