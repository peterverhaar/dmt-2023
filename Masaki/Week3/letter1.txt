     Dear Mr.Woolf,<br>
     The trouble about the rise of 15% lies in the <br>
     figures of American production costs, which are of course, higher <br>
     than over here, and in the fact that the American bookseller has <br>
     established a claim to a higher percentage reduction from the <br>
     publisher than he receives over here. We can make a profit on<br>
     15%, but only if we are able to have a run of something like<br>
     10,000 copies at the beginning - that is to say, if the author's<br>
     market is established. If we have to print in driblets, 15%<br>
     to the author just wipes out our profit. Ten per cent we <br>
     can do. Now, Hampson may be a great success, but at the best <br>
     he is an experiment. I don't know exactly what shall print,<br>
     but I am sure it will have to be small.

    Some day , hempson, I hope will be a big <br>
    seller. but if this is to be so, it will have to be partly<br>
    our doing. It is really to his interest to let us have a <br>
    chance and not press too hard at the beginning.
