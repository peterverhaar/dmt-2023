        <maintext1>Dear Sirs,<br>
        We are arranging to publish a little <br>
        anthology of war poems, and we should <br>
        very much like to include in it the poem<br>
        Voices of Women by Frank Prewett.</maintext1>

        <maintext2>We should be very glad if you could<br>
        give us permission to include this poem,<br>
        and perhaps you would kindly state what<br>
        fee you would require.</maintext2>

        <Greetings>Yours faithfully, <br>
        W.COLLINS SONS&amp;Co_LTD_</Greetings>
