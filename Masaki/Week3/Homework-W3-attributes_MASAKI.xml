    Modernism made an impact early in the 20th century century. Artists such as the Frenchman Henri Matisse, the Norwegian Edvard Munch (whose 1893
    <paintings>Scream</paintings>
    summed up modern urban alienation) and the
    Austrian Oskar Kokoschka used vivid colours and broad brushstrokes to express mood and emotion, and the personal feelings evoked by a situation rather than the way it literally looked. Much avant-garde modernist culture &#8208; books such as James Joyce&apos;s
    <novel>Ulysses</novel>, poems such as T. S. Eliot&apos;s
    <poems>The Waste Land</poems>
    and Ezra Pound&apos;s
    <poems>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</poems>, modern art, modern architecture, ballets staged by Sergei Diaghilev &#8208; was, for most of the first half of the 20th century, only enjoyed by small groups of intellectuals. The public reacted with jeers and contempt to Stravinsky&apos;s
    <ballet>The Rite of Spring</ballet>, and D.H. Lawrence&apos;s
    <novel>
      Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover</novel>
    has been banned in the UK for several decades. Whereas Pirandello's
    <play>Six Characters in Search of an Author</play>
    and Ionesco&apos;s
    <play>Rhinoceros</play>
    shaped the face of modernism in the theatre, their first stagings attracted extremely hostile public reactions.
