Dear Sirs, 


In reply to your inquiry concerning an anthology the Good Life (Eyre & Spottiswoode), this has not 1st been published. For reasons which will be all to familiar to you, it has been continuously held up. It is hoped, however, that the book will appear this summer; &, of course, as soon as it is published, the fee for Mr. Frank Prewett poem will be forwarded to you.

Yours faithfully

Henry Warren

Dear Sir,

Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego: Sigmund Freud
 
Thank you for your letter of May 2. We are putting in hand at once your order for 2600/2500 folded and collated sheets of the above book. 	As these sheets are not being printed by the same firm as THE FUTURE OF AN ILLUSION, I wonder if you could let us have another stereo of your collophon?

	With regard to the price, we have gone into the figures again, and although this is cutting things very fine for us, we feel that we should  like to meet you in this particular instance.	We will, therefore, invoice the sheets to you at 2s.2d. instead of 2s.2d. as previously quoted.

Yours truly, 

for The Hogarth Press Ltd.
Arthur Pell,Esq.,
