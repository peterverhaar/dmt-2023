Dear Sirs, 


In reply to your inquiry concerning an anthology the Good Life (Eyre & Spottiswoode), this has not 1st been published. For reasons which will be all to familiar to you, it has been continuously held up. It is hoped, however, that the book will appear this summer; &, of course, as soon as it is published, the fee for Mr. Frank Prewett poem will be forwarded to you.

Yours faithfully

Henry Warren

LETTER FROM ALINE BURCH TO MARTIN MELSTED (23/09/1948)

23rd September, 1948.

Martin Melsdted, Esq.,

N.W3.

Dear Sir,

With reference to your call at this office, I have discussed with Mr.Woolf the question of your arranging for LETTER TO A YOUNG POET by Virginia Woolf to be published in Danish.	We are willing for you to do this but should like to know whether you propose to publish it in a journal or whether you have a publisher interested in bringing it out in book form.	If the latter, we should, of course, have to have an agreement with the publisher and our charge would bee 10% royalty with an advance of Ten Guineas. 	If, on the other hand, you wish to publish it in a journal, we should charge a fee of Seven Guineas.	Perhaps you would be good enough to let me know what you proposed.

Yours faithfully,

for The Hogarth Press Ltd.
