Dear Sirs, 


In reply to your inquiry concerning an anthology the Good Life (Eyre & Spottiswoode), this has not 1st been published. For reasons which will be all to familiar to you, it has been continuously held up. It is hoped, however, that the book will appear this summer; &, of course, as soon as it is published, the fee for Mr, Frank Prewett poem will be forwarded to you.

Yours faithfully

Henry Warren
