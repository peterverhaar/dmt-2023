<h2>Who I am and how I got here</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone and welcome to my introductory page! I'm Sara. I apologise in advance for the difficult last 
        name, don't worry, I rarely use the weird letters here in the Netherlands and luckily my first name is 
        a bit more manageable (thanks mum!). However, despite the dread in people's faces when they try to 
        pronounce it, my name does indeed give away a lot about myself. I'm from Iceland - the country of 
        "dóttir" and "son" and some strange letters other languages really don't bother with anymore. 
        I grew up under quite different circumstances than my current living situation. For example, more 
        people live in my current city (The Hague) than live in my whole country and I grew up on a
        <a href="https://fastinn.is/details?assetId=1000432"> farm </a> with 
        horses and sheep (and my lovely dog!). There are no trains but instead lots and lots of mountains 
        where the Netherlands really can't compare. But with not so many people around, I grew up reading a lot
        and completely falling in love with the world of books. With some twists and turns in the road, I
        find myself still living in the Netherlands after having finished my undergraduate degree in 
        <a href="/education/study-programmes/bachelor/international-studies">International Studies</a> and 
        now I am hoping to continue to work with books and publishing for years to come which of course starts
        with the <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/media-studies/book-and-digital-media-studies">BDMS MA</a> program. </p></body>

<h2>BDMS starting point and expectations</h2>
        <table border="5" style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <td style="width:20%"><b>Prior Knowledge</b></td> <td style="width:80%">I am somewhat of a blank page when it comes to digital 
            media technology. This is my first encounter with HTML and CSS. However, I have worked on some
        projects in LaTeX format using Overleaf. It has given an insight into coding language and functions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> <b>Expectations</b></td> <td>In this course I hope to learn the basics of coding language and
        how it can be used to create and transform digital texts. I hope to gain an understandings of the 
        makeup of the digital platforms that are used in publishing, online archives etc. This course
        was for me one of the major selling points of the program as it equips us with hard skills that
        I'm sure will be valuable as we venture out into the big scary world of work.</td>

<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Books:</b> Well obviously! I'm not always the best with staying consistent 
            in my reading habits, but I eventually always come back to books. 
            My favorite author is Fredrik Backman and my favorite books are his Björnstad (Beartown) series.</li> 
       <li><b>Badminton:</b> It used to be my sport as a kid and I've just recently started playing again.
            It has been a humbling experience, but I really love it!</li>
       <li><b>Whales:</b> I admit that it's a bit of an obscure one, but I really love whales! If you ever feel 
       like you need some whale trivia in your life - I'm your guy.</li>
       <li><b>Sailing:</b> I have been lucky enough to work on sailboats and learn the basics. I completely
           fell in love with it from day one. </li>
       <li><b>Crafts:</b> I learned to knit young and I recently learned how to crochet. I like doing 
           small projects every now and again. I have the cutest little niece in the whole wide world and
            she's lovely insiration for crafts projects (If she would only stop growing so fast!).</li>
            <li><b>Horses:</b> I grew up riding horses so they will always have a special place in my heart. </li>
        </ul>
