 <text>Dear</text> 
 <name>
    <namerecipient> Mrs. Woolf: </namerecipient> 
 </name>
 <text>Thank you for your letter of</text> <date> <dateother> June 30th </dateother> </date> <text>enclosing the signed copy of the 
 agreement for</text> <booktitle><booktitlemain> A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN </booktitlemain></booktitle><text>. I am quite willing to have you retain
the Canadian rights if you wish.</text>
<text> In regard to serialization, I had been doing nothing because I thought it was your wish to abandon the idea. 
    In</text><name><nameother>Mr. Woolf's</nameother></name><text>letter of</text><date><dateother>May 16th,</dateother></date>
    <text>he said:</text> <quote>"We will not trouble about serialization, but go straight ahead with publication in book form."</quote> <text>
    And besides, the manuscript has been in </text> <name><nameother>Mr. Wells's</nameother></name><text> hands. I got the manuscript back
    from him yesterday, and have delivered it to </text><company> The Bookman (underscore).</company> <text> I am sorry if I have misinterpreted 
        your wishes, but no doubt there is still time as far as </text> <company>The Bookman (underscore)</company> <text>is concerned.

Meanwhile, just after I received your letter,</text><name><nameother>Curtis Brown's</nameother></name><text> office telephoned to ask if they
could get the manuscript, saying that they had a message from you to get in touch with us about it. I believe</text><company> 
The Bookman (underscore)</company> <text>had already been asking</text> <name><nameother>Curtis Brown.</nameother></name><text> 
If I get further inquiries from </text><name><nameother>Curtis Brown,</nameother></name><text>I shall tell them that we are dealing 
with the matter by your instructions. Of course, if it appears that the business ought to go through with 
</text><name><nameother>Curtis Brown</nameother></name><text> and they ought to have commission, we should be glad to stand aside as 
far as any commission is concerned and continue to do what we can do to dispose of the rights.</text>

 <name><nameother>Mr. Wells</nameother></name> <text>tells me that he has made you an offer in respect to a limited edition. If there is to 
 be a limited edition, we shall gladly co-operate with</text> <name><nameother>Mr. Wells</nameother></name><text> and with you in 
 regard to arranging dates of publication and protection of the copyright. I hope it may be possible for you to send soon finally corrected 
 proofs, especially if there is to be a limited edition. If you could arrange to send duplicate final proofs so that</text>
 <name><nameother>Mr. Wells</nameother></name><text> could have one set and we could have the other, matters would be greatly expedited.

There is one thing about the limited edition matter which I think I ought to mention, though I do so with some hesitation. When I recommended
the publication of a limited edition of</text> <booktitle><booktitleother>ORLANDO</booktitleother></booktitle> <text>by</text> 
<name><nameother> Mr. Gaige,</nameother></name> <text>my recommendation was based on long knowledge of him and complete certainty of his
reliability. As for his successors, I have not the same knowledge or the same certainty, and I should have hesitated to make a similar 
recommendation. Of course, you are dealing with</text> <name><nameother>Messrs (unsure). Wells</nameother></name><text>and</text>
<name><nameother>(unsure about this word)</nameother></name><text>direct, and it is probably all right for you to take
whatever risk is involved. It is simply that I really know next to nothing about them, and that in succeeding</text>
<name><nameother>Mr. Gaige,</nameother></name> <text>they do not succeed the 
complete confidence I have in him. Please don't take this any more seriously than it is intended.</text>

        <text>With kindest regards to yourself and </text><name><nameother>Mr. Woolf,</nameother></name>
        <text>Yours sincerely,</text>
        <name><namesender>Donald C. Brace.</namesender></name>
