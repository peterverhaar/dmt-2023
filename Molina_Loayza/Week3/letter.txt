Dear Sirs, 

Your two letters addressed to Monks House Rodmell have now reached us. Will you please note that the above is the address of the Hogarth Press. 
Mr. Woolf has asked me to tell you that as soon as we receive proofs of The Captain's Death Bed by Virginia Woolf, he will let you have one for consideration. Your enquiry for the Italian rights in Vol. V of Freud's Collected Papers has been passed to Mr. Ernst Freud who handles these rights.
Your other letter referring to the Italian rights in William Sansom's books has been passed to The Society of Authors who met as agents to this author. 

Yours Faithfully, 

Arnoldo Mondatori Editore, 
Via Corridoni N.39, Milan, Italy
