            <body>
                <p> Your two letters addressed to Monks House Rodmell have now reached us. Will you please note that the above is the address of the Hogarth Press. </p>
                <p> Mr. Woolf has asked me to tell you that as soon as we receive proofs of <title>The Captain&apos;s Death Bed</title> by <name>Virginia Woolf</name>, he will let you have one for consideration. Your enquiry for the Italian rights in Vol. V of Freud&apos;s <title>Collected Papers</title> has been passed to Mr. Ernst Freud who handles these rights. </p>
                <p> Your other letter referring to the Italian rights in William Sansom&apos;s books has been passed to The Society of Authors who met as agents to this author. </p>
            </body>
            <closing>
                <salute> Yours Faithfully, </salute>
