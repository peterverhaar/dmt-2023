        <p><b> N. Nimue Molina L. </b></p>
        <p> Hello! My name Nimue (but if it's hard to remember Natasha is also fine).</p>
        <p><i> I'm 23, originally from Bolivia and currently living in Utrecht.</i></p>
        <br />
        <p> I was born in Bolivia and grew up there, but went to a French school for the most of my life so I was expected to go abroad to study, but as I didn't like the French schooling system, I ended up here.</p>
        <p> I moved to the Netherlands 5 years ago to study Fine Arts but found it unsatisfying and decided to join the Literary Studies Bachelor at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/bachelors/literary-studies">Utrecht University</a> thinking it would be easy <i>(it wasn't)</i>.</p>
        <p> I'm generally a bit of a workaholic and despite not studying it anymore I've been engaged in art for most of my life. </p>
        <p> Besides writing and doing illustration for my personal projects I'm also currently involved the production of a Video Game with a group of my friends.</p>
        <p> Academically I'm very interested in the conservation of books (and art), and the historical analysis of texts. </p>
