<h1><b>Lovely to meet you!</b></h1>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Mishka, I'm 24 years old and I'm from Slovakia. I moved to Leiden in August 2023. Before that, I finished my Bachelor degree in European languages and cultures at the <a href= "http://www.rug.nl/ ">University of Groningen</a>.</p>

<p>What I love most are stories, whether in the form of books, movies, shows or music. My favorites are usually set in worlds where I can escape to in my head, like Star Wars or a Song of Ice and Fire. Besides that, my biggest interest is travelling.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Seoul</li>
